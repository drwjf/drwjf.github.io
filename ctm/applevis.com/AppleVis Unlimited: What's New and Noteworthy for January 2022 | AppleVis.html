<h4>Ballyland Magic Plus (iOS/iPadOS, US$5.99)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ballyland Magic Plus teaches young students essential skills and concepts for VoiceOver accessibility, Apple’s built-in screen reader, while they are playing a fun game!</p>
  
  <p>Join thousands of educators around the world and give your blind or visually impaired students a head-start in using an iPad. Ballyland Magic “Plus”, like the original Ballyland Magic app, teaches young students essential skills and concepts for VoiceOver accessibility, Apple’s built-in screen reader, while they are playing a fun game! Completely re-engineered, Ballyland Magic Plus offers additional features and even more learning, as well as improved interaction. The gestures incorporated in this app are: finger drag, split-tap, double tap, single finger flick right/left, and three-finger flick right/left. The popular Tap-tap song motivates even reluctant learners to successfully master the important ‘double tap’, tapping along with the rhythm. In line with the story of the cute Ballylanders who practice their ‘magic’ tricks, your student gradually builds ‘magic’ VoiceOver finger gesture skills, leading up to the Grand Finale: the Magic Show will only go ahead if the student takes charge and effectively performs the practiced gestures – a great way for you to assess a student’s progress!</p>

<h4>lire (macOS, US$9.99)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Love RSS feeds? So do we!!</p>
  
  <p>RSS feeds are a great way to follow updates on your favorite website. However, some sites set up their feeds to only show a portion of each entry, you know, to get you to click through to their actual website. We find that really annoying, and we're sure you do too.</p>
  
  <p>Which is why, unlike other RSS feed readers, that either push you into a browser (in-app or otherwise), or depend on third party text parsing services and require you to be online to fetch the full text of one article at a time (which makes it no different from having to click/tap through to a website), in lire, you get your favorite RSS feeds as they should've been. You don't need to click through to any website (though, you do still have the option to, if you really wanted). It takes your favorite partial feeds, does it's magic, and converts them in to full feeds, so you don't have to click/tap on those annoying 'Read more' or 'Continue reading' links.</p>
  
  <p>Once they're cached, you don't even need to be connected to read your full-text feeds.</p>
  
  <p>Use as a standalone feed reader or sync with any of the several services: Feedly, Feedbin, FeedHQ, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, Newsblur, Feed Wrangler, FreshRSS, Miniflux, Nextcloud News, Tiny Tiny RSS.</p>

<h4>Sonar Islands (iOS/iPadOS, Free With In-App Purchases)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sonar Islands is a MULTIPLAYER ONLINE game, where all relevant events happen in your ears.</p>
  
  <p>On various islands you explore and discover, seek hidden TREASURES and conquer OBSTACLES. Every new island has a special atmosphere and a different gameplay. Do your best to fortify your islands and be clever enough to take the gold from your opponents.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Visit the ancient TEMPLE island, the ancestors built, where snakes are biting and down falling parts may block your way.</li>
  <li>Take a trip to the JUNGLE island, watch abandoned lions on your way, but be aware of the tree traps, set up by the natives. You can go up, but there is no coming down.</li>
  <li>The FUN FAIR island is a happy place to be. You can shoot toys coming towards you. Some carry a treasure, some carry a bomb, that's the risk.</li>
  <li>The VOLCANO island is a chilly place, for some too hot, especially if you step near the lava flows. Ash and stone rain down due to the eruptions of terraforming, raise your shield to protect you.</li>
  <li>In the MACHINE HALL you will meet the friendly robots from Feer, but this time you carry a stun gun to short-circuit their brains, at least for a while, till their self-repair is complete.</li>
  <li>On PING island you will get a sonar device for orientation, send out a tone and the echo tells you, where to go. That’s good, because you may discover, this island is a labyrinth.</li>
  <li>High up on the TREETOP island you have to deal with wind and mosquitos. The wind is really disorientating, leaves are rustling, while the mosquitos chase you. And don't fall, while balancing on the twigs.</li>
  <li>On the ELECTRO island you face the invisible power of ELECTRICITY. Tesla coils sparkle round their high voltage, better shoot some metal confetti to divert the current. The nice thing here are catapult plates, they make you fly all over the island. A pity, that you don’t know where you will end up.</li>

<h4>Rising from the Flames: New Life for an Old iPad</h4>

<p>By Paul Martz | January 13, 2022</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On December 30th 2021, a wildfire incinerated nearly a thousand homes and retail establishments in Boulder County Colorado. I live a safe 8 miles from the destruction, but others were not as fortunate. I know many families who lost everything.</p>
  
  <p>My spouse and I decided to move into my father-in-law's guest suite and rent our house to one of the displaced families. Our new tenants tell a terrifying story. A police cruiser announced "get out, now!" over a loudspeaker as it drove through their neighborhood. The air was thick with smoke as they fled with other panicked families. They escaped with their smartphones, laptops, three cats, and little else. Their loss and grief is beyond words.</p>
  
  <p>For many reasons, we left our wi-fi network in place. Our tenants had nothing and needed the wi-fi an printer. I also host a web server. It made sense for me to leave my Mac Mini desktop and drop by as-needed to help them with any tech issues and perform routine server maintenance. This meant I'd need to assemble a new computing environment from what I brought to my temporary home: my iPhone SE, a Bluetooth keyboard, a pair of wired earbuds, an Aftershockz headset, my Braille display - and my fourth-generation iPad from 2012.</p>
  
  <p>Why do I still have this truly ancient iPad? A fair question. It's old, outdated, and heavy as a doorstop. It only has 16GB and won't upgrade beyond iOS 10.3.3. I kept it for the large screen, useful for trying to see photos or videos with my remaining crappy vision. At the same time, my eyesight has become so poor that I could not justify upgrading to a more recent model. It fell into disuse and I simply never got around to recycling it. So, here it is, and now I would find out if I could use this old iPad as a desktop replacement.</p>
  
  <p>I'm retired and write for a hobby. I need Zoom on my iPhone to participate in my writing groups, and Scrivener and Google Docs on my iPad to write, review, edit, and make comments. I knew how to do all this on my Mac Mini with ease. Now I would need to re-learn everything. IOS wasn't foreign to me, but using Zoom, Scrivener, and Google Docs as iOS apps would challenge me with a user experience that was very different from my Mac.</p>

<h4>Teach Vision Impaired Youngsters VoiceOver Skills and Concepts with the Ballyland Magic Plus app</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this podcast, Kushal Solanki gives us a walkthrough and demonstration of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ballyland-magic-plus/id1510039691">Ballyland Magic Plus</a>, and iOS app that utilizes games to teach youngsters how to use VoiceOver.</p>
  
  <p>From the App Store:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Join thousands of educators around the world and give your blind or visually impaired students a head-start in using an iPad. Ballyland Magic “Plus”, like the original Ballyland Magic app, teaches young students essential skills and concepts for VoiceOver accessibility, Apple’s built-in screen reader, while they are playing a fun game! Completely re-engineered, Ballyland Magic Plus offers additional features and even more learning, as well as improved interaction. The gestures incorporated in this app are: finger drag, split-tap, double tap, single finger flick right/left, and three-finger flick right/left. The popular Tap-tap song motivates even reluctant learners to successfully master the important ‘double tap’, tapping along with the rhythm. In line with the story of the cute Ballylanders who practice their ‘magic’ tricks, your student gradually builds ‘magic’ VoiceOver finger gesture skills, leading up to the Grand Finale: the Magic Show will only go ahead if the student takes charge and effectively performs the practiced gestures – a great way for you to assess a student’s progress!</p>
