        <li>An iOS game inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Escape_(1986_video_game)">The Great
                Escape game</a> published in 1986 for the MS-DOS.</li>
        <li>The player assumes the role of an anonymous prisoner of war, incarcerated in a POW camp located in northern
            Germany during the year 1942. Situated on a small castle perched on a promontory, the camp is surrounded on
            three sides by cliffs that descend into the cold waters of the North Sea. Access to the camp is limited to a
            narrow road leading through the gatehouse, with entry granted only to those possessing the necessary
            documents. The rest of the camp is enclosed by fences and walls, vigilantly patrolled by guard dogs, and
            overseen by watchful guards stationed in observation towers equipped with searchlights to prevent prisoner
            escape attempts.</li>
        <li>Beneath the camp lies an intricate network of tunnels and drains, though these areas pose considerable
            danger without a source of light. The player's primary objective is to break free from the confines of the
            camp. Various strategies and methods can be employed to achieve this goal.</li>
        <li>The gaming environment features an isometric 2.5D perspective, placing the player's character initially in
            bed at the start of each day within the camp. Every prisoner, including the player's character, adheres to a
            daily schedule that encompasses roll call, exercise sessions, meal times, and lights-out. If the player
            temporarily relinquishes control of their character, the character will autonomously follow this prescribed
            routine. In this environment, camp guards maintain a watchful presence. They will apprehend the player's
            character if they observe any deviation from the established routine. Notably, the guards only detain
            characters upon direct contact and will only identify prisoners within their line of sight or when indoors.
