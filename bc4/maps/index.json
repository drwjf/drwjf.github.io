In 1904, Japan did not declare war, raided Lushun during the training of the Russian Navy's Far East Squadron stationed in Lushun, and landed in Inchon. The angry Tsarist Russia transferred the elite troops of East Siberia and the Baltic Fleet to the Far East and declared war on Japan. Thus began the Russian War. At the same time, the Qing Empire declared that both were allies and thus remained neutral. The war was ultimately won by Japan, and the Treaty of Portsmouth was signed with Russia under the coordination of the United Kingdom. But in this parallel world, there are historical observers who faithfully observe and record history.", "zh":"近代以来，中国东北一直是日俄两国争夺的焦点。1904年，日本不宣而战，在驻扎在旅顺的俄罗斯海军远东分舰队训练时突袭旅顺，并登陆仁川，愤怒的沙俄将东西伯利亚的精锐部队和波罗的海舰队调援远东，并向日本宣战，日俄战争就此打响。与此同时，清帝国宣布两者皆为友邦，因此保持中立。战争最终以日本胜利，并在英国的协调下与沙俄签订了《朴茨茅斯条约》。但在这个平行世界，却存在着忠实观察并记录历史的历史观察者。"}},
