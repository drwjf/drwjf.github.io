There is a large river meandering into the sea in the western part of the map, forming a fertile delta named 'Buyaga River'. It has many tributaries, creating forests, hills, plains, etc. in the vast mountains for people to build cities. In addition to the Buyaga River, there are many rivers in the map that flow between the mountains, some flowing into the sea, and some flowing into inland lakes in the basin. There is a large saltwater lake in the northeast corner of the map, surrounded by plains, hills, and forests, and beyond that, there are mountains that cannot be seen. People here are also accustomed to living in isolation in the basin and are not as keen on war as the countries along the Buyaga River. There is a lot more to be said in the mountains, but now I want to talk about the sea. The coast here is not straight, there is a large opening made by the Buyaga River in the west, and there is a large peninsula almost entirely composed of mountains in the east. People living in the coastal areas are lucky, because they are close to the south and the sea, they can enjoy the warmer sunshine, the warm and humid water vapor from the sea, and the food presented by the sea. There are many small islands in the sea, most of which are small and rugged, and difficult to live in. However, there is a large island in the southwest, with mountains, hills, and large fertile grasslands. People who live here do not know. What is hunger, do not know what is sadness, they created their own powerful marine civilization.", "zh":"这张地图的主题是大比例的山群与海洋。有一条大河在西部蜿蜒着流入大海，形成肥沃的三角洲，被命名为“布亚加河”。它拥有着众多的支流，在茫茫一片的山岭中为人们创造了可以建立城市居住的森林、丘陵、平原等。除了布亚加河，地图中还有许多河流淌在山间，有些汇入大海，有些则流入盆地中的内陆湖泊。东北角就有一个很大的咸水湖，周围有着平原和丘陵、森林，再往外就是望不到边的大山。这里的人们也习惯了盆地中与世隔绝的生活，不像布亚加河沿岸的国家那样热衷于战争。山中可以说的还有很多，不过现在我要说一说海。这里的海岸算不上平直，西部有一个布亚加河造成的大口子，东部还有一个几乎完全由山地组成的大型半岛。居住在沿海一带的人们是幸运的，因为靠南、靠海，他们可以享受更加温暖和煦的阳光、暖湿的来自大海的水汽，以及大海馈赠的食物。大海中还有许多小岛，大多很小，且地势崎岖，难以居住，不过西南面有一个大岛，上面有山、有丘陵，更有大块的富饶的草原，在这里居住的人们不知道什么叫饥饿，不知道什么叫忧愁，他们创造了属于自己的强大的海洋文明。"}},

A mysterious oriental will has transformed the moon to have the conditions of the earth. The ocean is filled with the moon, and the deepest depth is 3000m, which is based on the lowest altitude on the lunar surface. The craters on the moon are proof that countless meteorites have been blocked for the earth, and now they also breed oceans, forming a unique geographical environment. But a large number of craters also hindered access to water, and meteorites also shattered the terrain, leaving plains scarce. Forests also took over water sources one step ahead of humans. But the resources are still very rich. At the same time, MC players told us: If you want to get rich, you must first hit the tree.", "zh":"月球自古以来一直是人类想征服的对象。某神秘东方意志改造了月球使之拥有了地球的条件，海洋填充了月球，最深深度为3000m，是以月球表面最低海拔处为基准。月球上的环形山是为地球挡下无数陨石的证明，现在也孕育了海洋，形成了独特的地理环境。但是大量的环形山也阻碍了取水，陨石也使得地形破碎，平原稀少。森林也比人类先一步占领了水源。但是资源还是十分丰富的，同时MC玩家告诉我们：想致富先撸树(￣▽￣)。"}},
