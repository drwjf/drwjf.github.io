        Introduction
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    BC4000 is a single player, turn-based strategy game for iOS platform inspired by the Sid Meier's Civilization series.  Most graphics, music, map and text materials come from public domain licensed by Creative Commons License or General Public License.  The core data structure design is impacted by the Freeciv project heavily.
    <p>
    Player take the role of tribal leaders in 4000 B.C., compete against
    AI opponents to found cities, support military and economy, and finally
    to complete an empire that survives all encounters with its neighbors
    to emerge victorious.  To construct new city buildings and deploy of new
    units, new technologies should be discovered.  You can wage war on
    one another or form diplomatic relationships with AI opponents.
    <p>
    Achieving success requires a balance between economic expansion,
    military strength, and technological development.  Not only must you
    develop all three in concert to both expand and successfully defend
    your empire, but any of the three may provide victory over your
    opponents:
    <p>
    - As in other games of conquest and expansion, you are declared the
    winner by default once the last city and unit of every other
    civilization is destroyed.
    <p>
    - Once technological progress has brought you into the space age,
    you may launch a spacecraft destined for Alpha Centauri; the
    first civilization whose craft reaches the system wins.
    <p>
    - In the absence of other means to determine victory, the game will
    end after 5000 turns if no spacecraft have yet been launched.  The
    surviving civilizations are then rated, and the one with the highest
    score is the winner.
