The United States of America achieved its independence from Great Britain after a revolution in 1776-1783 CE. Its constitution was proclaimed in 1789, making the country one of the first modern representative republics. The United States then started to expand its territory, first on the North American mainland and later also overseas. By the 20th century the country had become a world superpower; its cultural, economic and political influence on the rest of the world is enormous.

Attila died in 453, and the empire fell apart one year later. The origins of the Huns are still a matter of dispute; they have long been associated with the Xiongnu mentioned in Chinese sources, but that link has still not been unequivocally proven. Hunnic ethnic relations and language are likewise controversial.

<h2>
Incas
</h2>

<p>
The Inca were an Amerind people of the Northern Andes who conquered an empire stretching along the west coast of South America from what is now southern Chile nearly to the Equator. They had the bad timing to do it just a few decades before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in their part of the world in the 1530s CE. In that short time frame, the Inca were able to build over 15,000 km of roads throughout their realm. Their state was the largest in the Americas prior to the Spanish conquest and was maintained through a complex, hierarchical and pragmatic administrative system. They were, however, wracked as many kingdoms have been by crises of succession. When the Spanish arrived, the Inca were in the middle of one such crisis - the war between Atawallpa and Waskhar. They were the sons of the late ruler Wayna Qhapaq, who had died from disease - likely smallpox - that was sweeping through the land.

Spanish accounts paint them as a peaceful people compared to their Carib neighbors to the south. Their dugout canoes, which were often nearly as long as Columbus' ships, ferried traders between islands. Recent genetic studies show that roughly half of Puerto Ricans have Taino maternal descent.
