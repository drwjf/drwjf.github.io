<p>
California is the largest US state by population and economy. First populated by Native Americans, it was colonized by Spanish missionaries in the 18th century. California became a territory of Mexico upon that country's independence. During the Mexican-American War local American settlers proclaimed the 'Bear Flag Republic', which was incorporated into the United States shortly thereafter. The 1848 Gold Rush brought massive numbers of immigrants to California. In the 20th century the state became a center of the world's entertainment and technology industries.

Cañaris
</h2>

<p>
The Cañaris were a pre-Columbian civilization in what is now Ecuador, whose existence can be traced from the 6th century onwards. They were one of the few Andean cultures not to worship the sun. The Cañari language was probably related to the Mochica language of Peru, but by the time of the Spanish conquest the Cañaris had mostly switched to Quechua. The Cañaris formed a loose confederation with their main political center in Guapdondelig, currently the city of Cuenca, capital of the province of Azuay. They were subjugated by the Incas in the late 15th century, though they put up a fierce resistance. They rebelled during the Incan civil war and sided with the Spanish during their conquest of the Inca empire.

<h2>
Carantanians
</h2>

<p>
The Carantanians or Alpine Slavs were an Early Medieval confederation of South West Slavic tribes who settled in modern-day Austria. The Duchy of Carantania was one of the earliest Slav states, existing since the seventh century CE. In the eighth century, it fell into dependence on the Frankish kingdom, which led to the adoption of Christianity in the Latin rite by duke Gorazd. In 819 years Carantania joined the revolt of the Croatian duke Ljudevit Posavski. After its fall in 822 the state was abolished and incorporated directly into the realm of the Franks. Slovenians are the modern descendants of the Carantanians.

During the colonial era Central America formed the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Central America declared independence from Spain in 1821, shortly joined Mexico, and then formed a federal republic. Struggles between Guatemala and the other provinces and between liberals and conservatives led to the federation's demise. By 1840 the federation had ceased to exist. Later attempts of reunification all failed, though since 1993 the Central American republics cooperate in the Central American Integration System (SICA).

<h2>
Central Lithuanians
</h2>

<p>
Lithuanian Poles are an ethnic minority in Lithuania, mainly in the Aukshtota region. They are a remnant of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth - the Commonwealth of Two Nations, which was founded with the Union of Lublin in 1569. This state united the Kingdom of Poland with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and was founded by the Lithuanian grand duke Jogaila, who was baptized with the name Władysław. The presence of the first Polish community in Lithuania dates back to duke Mindaugas of Lithuania. The first Poles came to Lithuania as prisoners of war taken during raids on the frontier lands (mainly to Mazovia). After uniting the two countries there was a very strong Polonization of the Lithuanian nobility. The Polish-speaking community in Lithuania survived the collapse and partition of the Polish state, co-existing with Lithuanian-speaking people. In 1920, the rebellious general Żeligowski announced the creation of a Republic of Central Lithuania, which was then incorporated into Poland. After World War II most of the Lithuanian Poles were displaced to Poland's new western territories.

Reports of chynocephaly (having the head of a dog or jackal) can be traced to Greek Antiquity. The physician Ctesias and the traveler Megasthenes placed them in India. In the middle ages, Giovanni da Pian and Marco Polo made reference to them, while the theologian Ratramnus debated whether they should be considered human or not. Various stories have placed them in Scotland, Canaan, Cyrenaica, and the Andaman Islands. The country 'Chananea' comes from the German poet Walter of Speyer. In the account by Sir John Mandeville, the people were known as the Nacumerians.

<p>
One of the so-called Five Civilized Tribes, the Choctaw traditionally occupied much of the middle and south of today's U.S. state of Mississippi. First encountered by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, they became long-time French allies before siding with the Confederate States during the American Civil War. The majority of Choctaw today live in Oklahoma following forced removal from their homeland under president Andrew Jackson in 1831, but there is also a vibrant band in Mississippi made up of Choctaw who managed to escape removal and stay behind. The word "Oklahoma" itself is derived from a Choctaw language term meaning "red people".

<h2>
Chumash
</h2>

<p>
Inhabiting the Santa Barbara Channel Islands and the southern California coastline between Malibu and Paso Robles inland towards the San Joaquin valley, the Chumash lived in large permanent villages and maintained a semi-monetized economy. These villages came to be ruled by hereditary chiefs, who could be male or female. At time of contact, the population was likely 8-18,000 people, though perhaps as high as 22,000. The Spanish established five missions in Chumash land. As a result of disease and other byproducts of colonial rule, the population fell to less than 3,000 in 1831.

The Circassians are the indigenous peoples of the Northwest Caucasus. The Circassian or Adyghe language is part of the Northwest Caucasian language family, related to Kabardian, Abkhaz and Ubykh. The Circassians first emerged as a coherent entity some 6000 years ago. They were rarely politically united; nevertheless they successfully managed to resist countless invasions from great empires throughout their history. Circassians were never fully subjugated in their long history until the middle of the 19th century, when they were defeated and subjected to genocide at the hands of the Russian Empire. Today less than 10% of the Circassian population lives in their original homeland.

<h2>
Confederates
</h2>

<p>
The Confederate States of America was a splinter nation of the United States, formed by eleven Southern states, existing from 1861 to 1865. The states seceded from the United States because of political and cultural differences with the North, most prominently the issue of slavery, which they feared the government of the recently elected United States president Abraham Lincoln would abolish. The Confederate capital was Richmond, Virginia, and Jefferson Davis was the country's only president. The American Civil War pitted the Confederacy against the United States. After several military defeats by United States troops the southern states had to abandon their claims of independence; much of their territory laid in ruins. Furthermore, the Union victory in the Civil War opened the way for the abolition of slavery in the United States.

<p>
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is a big country in Central Africa. Despite (or because of) its wealth of natural resources it has been in ruins for most of its modern history. In 1885 Congo was awarded to Léopold II of Belgium as his personal possession, the Congo Free State, which turned the country into a slaughterhouse. At least twenty per cent of the population perished and after an international outcry it became a Belgian colony in 1906. It achieved independence in 1960. The Mobutu dictatorship started a new round of pillaging. When Mobutu was toppled the country sank into a civil war, causing five million deaths, the bloodiest event since World War II.

Eritreans
</h2>

<p>
Eritrea is a country in eastern Africa which borders Sudan, Ethiopia, and Djibouti. It was once the Kingdom of D'mt and was later conquered by Italy. In 1951 it was federated with Ethiopia, which led to the development of an independence movement in the 1960s. In 1991 the 31-year war ended with Eritrea gaining independence.

<h2>
Etruscans
</h2>

<p>
The Etruscans were an ancient civilization in Etruria, Italy, known for their artistic achievements and building of necropolises. Their language is only partly deciphered and their origins are still debated. They called themselves Rasna and formed a confederation of twelve cities. In the 6th century the Etruscan civilization started to crumble after Roman and Gallic incursions. Rome itself probably originated as a city state that threw off Etruscan domination. As a result, Roman sources often put the Etruscans in a negative light, depicting them as a sexually licentious culture. However, Roman civilization owes a lot to their Etruscan predecessors.

<h2>
Europeans
</h2>

<p>
The foundation for the European Union was laid in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome. The EU project has developed since then and is beginning to resemble a fledgeling super state. But the question remains: Does such a thing as a common European identity and nation actually exist?

Flemings
</h2>

<p>
In the Middle Ages, Flanders was a county on the border of France and the Holy Roman Empire. In the 15th century, it came under Habsburg domination and subsequently it became one of the Seventeen Netherlands. Only after its conquest by Revolutionary France was the county legally dissolved. Nowadays the name is applied to the Dutch (or Flemish) speaking part of Belgium.

<h2>
Florentines
</h2>

<p>
The Florentine Republic was founded upon the overthrow of the Margraviate of Tuscany in 1115. Despite its seemingly endemic political intrigues, it became the most magnificent city-state of its era. Florence was the cultural and philosophical leader of Italy and indeed Europe in Renaissance, bringing forth such luminaries as Dante, Savonarola, Michelangelo, Da Vinci and Machiavelli. The De' Medici family eventually managed to consolidate its hold on Florence, and in the 16th century the Republic was turned into the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1859 it was annexed by Italy.

<h2>
Formosans
</h2>

<p>
Taiwan is home to fourteen officially recognized and twelve unrecognized tribes, all of whom are traditionally speakers of a group of Austronesian languages known as Formosan. Historical linguists consider the island to be the home of the Austronesian family, as it is host to the most diverse set of Austronesian languages. Many of the tribes are traditionally matrilineal. Starting in the 17th century, European and East Asian colonists vied for control of the island, encroaching on aboriginal lands. Today, Formosans constitute around 2% of the population of Taiwan.

<h2>
Franconians
</h2>

<p>
Franconia was one of the stem duchies of the Holy Roman Empire. Founded in the 9th century, unlike the other stem duchies it didn't manage to consolidate itself and by the 12th century it had completely disappeared. Franconia continues to exist as a cultural region in the modern states of Bavaria, Thuringia and Baden-Wuerttemberg.
<br>

</p>

<h2>
Franks
</h2>

<p>
The Franks were a Germanic confederation that formed in what is now Northwest Germany in the 3rd century CE. In the late 5th century their leader Clovis converted to Christianity, united the Frankish tribes and conquered much of Gaul. Clovis' successors expanded Frankish rule over much of Central Europe. The Frankish kingdom mixed Germanic and Roman elements and would lay the foundation for much of European Medieval culture, society and politics. After a period of stagnation the Frankish realm was reunited in the 8th century. In 800 the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor by the pope. Upon his death the Frankish Empire was divided once again. By the 10th century CE the Frankish empire had broken up for good into West Francia, which later became France, and East Francia, which later became the Holy Roman Empire or Germany.

<h2>
French
</h2>

<p>
France has long been a major power in Europe. French conquerors like Emperor Napoleon and King Charlemagne united large parts of Europe under the French flag. The country also built the world's second largest colonial empire. The French kingdom first came into existence when it grew out of the western part of the Frankish empire during the High Middle Ages. France - and indeed the world - was shaken on its foundations by the French Revolution of 1789.

<h2>
Frisians
</h2>

<p>
Romans already mentioned the Frisii but historians are unsure whether they were the ancestors of today's Frisians or not. In the early Middle Ages the Frisians controlled a kingdom stretching from the Scheldt to Jutland. Although eventually defeated by the Franks, they kept enjoying the famous Frisian freedom, refusing to recognize the rule of any feudal lord. In the 15th and 16th centuries Frisian territory was eventually carved up, the core becoming a province of the United Netherlands. In 1782 the Estates of Friesland was the first foreign government to recognize the independence of the United States of America.

<h2>
Friulian
</h2>

<p>
Friuli is a region in north-eastern Italy. A duchy of the Lombards and then a march of the Franks, it was ruled by the Patriarchs of Aquileia from the 11th century onward. In the 15th century Friuli was divided between Venice and Austria. The Friulian language is closely related to the Romansh language spoken in Switzerland.

<h2>
Fulani
</h2>

<p>
The Fulani or Fulbe are an ethnic group in West Africa. Originally pastoralists, in the 18th and 19th centuries they led the Fulani Jihads, founding a number of states across the region. The biggest Fulani state was the Sokoto Caliphate, founded by Usuman dan Fodio during the Fulani Jihad of 1809. It was one of the most powerful empires in Sub-Saharan Africa prior to the European conquest and colonization. The caliphate remained extant through the colonial period and afterwards, though with reduced power.

Gauls
</h2>

<p>
The Gauls were a Celtic people occupying what is now France and Belgium. They lived in chiefdom-level societies that grew increasingly centralized and stratified under the influence of the Greek and Roman merchants and soldiers who came to Gaul. Julius Caesar launched his eight year invasion of Gaul in 59 BCE. He claimed to have killed one million people and enslaved another million out of an original population of three million. The Gauls united and rallied under Vercingetorix, who defeated Caesar at the battle of Gergovia, but was later crushed by him at the battle of Alesia.

Genoese
</h2>

<p>
The Most Serene Republic of Genoa (Italian: Repubblica di Genova) was an independent state in Liguria on the northwestern Italian coast from the 11th century to 1797, when it was invaded by armies of Revolutionary France under Napoleon. It was then succeeded by the Ligurian Republic, which existed until 1805 before being annexed by the French Empire. Although its restoration was briefly proclaimed in 1814, following the defeat of Napoleon, this was short-lived, and the Republic was ultimately annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia.

<h2>
Gepids
</h2>

<p>
The Gepids were a group of ancient East Germanic tribes, closely related to the Goths. Their original settlement was located on the Scandinavian Peninsula. By the time of the wake of the Goths from Scandinavia they had relocated to the southern coast of the Baltic. According to Jordanes, they inhabited a land called Specis, near the mouth of the Vistula, probably located on the Elblag Uplands. After the migration of the Goths on the Black Sea, the Gepids extended their possessions in Pomerania. In the 3rd century CE they moved to Dacia. From the 4th to the mid 5th century they were under the authority of the Huns. After the death of Attila the Gepids moved to Pannonia, where they defeated the Huns in the Battle of the River Nedao and won a place to live east of the River Tisza. In Pannonia they fought constantly against the Longobards west of the Danube. In 567 the Longobards allied themselves with the nomadic Avars against the Gepids and defeated them, breaking up their country. Gepids formed part of the Avar Khaganate, founded on former Gepid territory.

<h2>
German Belgians
</h2>

<p>
The German-speaking Community is one of the three federal communities of Belgium, part of the Walloon Region in the extreme east of the country. The area was annexed by Belgium after the First World War to compensate the country for the German occupation during that war. With about 75,000 inhabitants the German-speaking Community comprises less than one percent of Belgium's population. Long neglected, the German-speaking Belgians now enjoy the same rights as their Flemish and French-speaking compatriots. As a result, they are often dubbed 'the best protected minority of Europe' and 'the last true Belgians'.
<br>

</p>

<h2>
Germanics
</h2>

<p>
The Germanic peoples are an ethno-linguistic complex in Northern and Northwestern Europe. The Germanic languages descended from a hypothetical Proto-Germanic language within the Indo-European language family. The first origins of the Ancient Germanic peoples are rather hypothetical; the Germanic languages contain numerous features that are nonexistent in other Indo-European languages. First attested on the North German Plain and in Southern Scandinavia, they clashed with the Romans from the second century BCE onward. Eventually, by the Early Middle Ages, Germanic kingdoms were established on what was once the Western Roman Empire. By this time most Germanic peoples had changed their ancestral polytheistic religion for Christianity.

<h2>
Himyar
</h2>

<p>
The Himyar were originally a mountain tribe in what is now Yemen that conquered the other South Arabian kingdoms, including Sabaea in 115 BCE, which were rich from the incense trade. The Himyar were castle-builders, finding it necessary to erect citadels to protect against Bedouin raids. The Axumite kingdom from Ethiopia ruled Sabaea from 340 to 378 CE, but the area was reconquered by Himyar forces in 525. The fall of the nation was a slow process involving the Christian states of Axum and the Byzantine Empire on one side, the Mandean Sassanid Empire of Persia on the other, and various South Arabian factions split between. The country switched from Axumite rule to Sassanid in 575 and in 628, the fifth Sassanid satrap of "al-Yaman" converted to Islam and Southern Arabia was incorporated into the new, expanding Muslim empire.

In the fifth century CE they created a powerful military empire under the leadership of Attila, famous for his campaigns against the Roman Empire. Attila died in 453, and the empire fell apart one year later. The origins of the Huns are still a matter of dispute; they have long been associated with the Xiongnu mentioned in Chinese sources, but that link has still not been unequivocally proven. Hunnic ethnic relations and language are likewise controversial.

<h2>
Incas
</h2>

<p>
The Inca were an Amerind people of the Northern Andes who conquered an empire stretching along the west coast of South America from what is now southern Chile nearly to the Equator. They had the bad timing to do it just a few decades before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in their part of the world in the 1530s CE. In that short time frame, the Inca were able to build over 15,000 km of roads throughout their realm. Their state was the largest in the Americas prior to the Spanish conquest and was maintained through a complex, hierarchical and pragmatic administrative system. They were, however, wracked as many kingdoms have been by crises of succession. When the Spanish arrived, the Inca were in the middle of one such crisis - the war between Atawallpa and Waskhar. They were the sons of the late ruler Wayna Qhapaq, who had died from disease - likely smallpox - that was sweeping through the land.

The existence of this people has been inferred from the analysis of Indo-European languages, on the basis of which attempts to reconstruct the Proto-Indo-European language have been made. One of the first scientists who noted the similarities between these languages was Sir William Jones.

By the early 1500s, the Burba Jolof could field as many as 100,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. Fulani and Berber incursions coupled with political weakness eroded away the power of the Burba Jolof. Various Wolof-speaking states established unions with one another, with their heads assuming the powers of Burba Jolof. The 19th century brought with it French colonization and a conversion to Islam fueled in large part by anti-European sentiment.

Mexico entered the modern era under Porfirio Díaz (1876-1911) but social inequality and political repression led to the Mexican Revolution of 1910 which left more than a million dead. The Revolution led to the establishment of a corporatist one party state in 1929. Only in 2000 did Mexico see its first democratic transfer of power.

During the decolonization process many Moluccans sided with the Dutch East Indies Army. This, and the centralism exerted by Java after Indonesia's independence in 1949, led to the proclamation of the Republic of the South Moluccas in 1950. The rebellion was crushed, but a government in exile continues to operate, not recognized by any country.

<p>
Called Pleasant Island by the European colonizers, Nauru is an island in the South Pacific. The island was first settled by Austronesian peoples around 1000 BCE. European contacts led to internecine tribal warfare which decimated the population. Nauru was annexed by the German Empire in 1888 but was occupied by Australia during World War I. In 1968, the Republic of Nauru became independent. Thanks to its enormous phosphate resources, Nauru was for some time the most developed third world country and one of the world's richest countries per capita. With the exhaustion of the phosphate reserves the country has fallen on economic hard times. Offshore banking, immigrant detention centers and musicals have proven unsuccessful to replace phosphate as source of income. Nauru is the world's third smallest country by size, second smallest by population. It is the smallest country in the Southern Hemisphere and the world's smallest republic.

The border between the two nations fluctuated time and time again. Lower Nubia was at times ruled by Egypt. The 25th Dynasty of Egypt, however, was a Nubian dynasty, and one that saw conflict with Assyria, which eventually wrested Egypt from Nubia. Brief conflict occurred with Rome in 24 BCE when Nubian armies routed the Roman garrison with its famed archers. Nubia was a nation shaped by its position between the Mediterranean world and the African interior. Large Nubian states centered on Napata and later Meroe broke into smaller Christian kingdoms which persisted into medieval times before being conquered by Muslim Arabs.

<p>
Paraguay is located in the heartland of South America. It was conquered by the Spanish in the late 16th century. The colony was mostly controlled by the Jesuits until their expulsion in 1767. In 1811, Paraguay was the first South American country to achieve independence from Spain. A number of highly authoritarian rulers governed the country as a tyranny but also turned it into a military and economic powerhouse. The War of the Triple Alliance of 1864-1870 led to the near annihilation of Paraguay, which lost half of its territory and eighty per cent of its male population. Paraguay's history remains marked by instability and authoritarianism, alhough it managed to defeat Bolivia in the Chaco War of 1932-1936. For much of the 20th century the country was ruled by General Stroessner, who provided a safe haven for Nazi war criminals. Around the turn of the millennium however Paraguay started to see a democratic system of government and an impressive economic growth.

After centuries of Roman and Byzantine rule, Pontus became an independent state again when in 1204 the Empire of Trebizond was founded as one of the successors of the crumbling Byzantine Empire. Under the Komnenos dynasty, Trebizond held out as the very last remnant of the Roman Empire until it finally fell to the Ottomans in 1461. During the Turkish-Greek population transfers after World War I, most Pontic Greeks were deported, and today the population of Pontus is almost exclusively Turkish.

</h2>

<p>
The P'urhepecha or Tarascans are a people native to the modern Mexican state of Michoacán, the heart of a former empire known to them as Irechikua Ts'intsuntsani, meaning the "lands of Tzintzuntzan," their capital city. Their kings were the perennial enemy of the Aztec empire, who attempted an unsuccessful invasion of the P'urhepecha lands. When the Spanish arrived and began their conquest of Mexico in 1519, the Aztecs sent an embassy seeking the support of the P'urhepecha, but were rebuffed. The conquistadores' reputation preceded them and the P'urhepecha offered to become a subject state of the King of Spain rather than meet the same fate as their former enemies, the Aztecs. Nevertheless, the transition to Spanish rule was not smooth and devolved into violence. The empire, founded around 1450 CE, collapsed in 1530.

<p>
The Seminole people emerged in the 18th century through a process of ethnogenesis, out of groups of lower Creek emigrants who fled the encroachment of White settlers in the U.S. state of Georgia and elsewhere, south to the Florida peninsula which at that time was under Spanish control. They intermingled with remnants of other tribes plus a significant number of Black African freedmen. Seminole leaders sided with the United States during the so-called Seminole wars against Spain, the outcome of which was the ceding of Florida to the U.S., and the removal of a majority of Seminoles to Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma. Together with the Cherokee, Choctaw, Muskogee, and Chickasaw, the Seminole are known as one of the "Five Civilized Tribes" for their relatively amiable relationships with White European settlers during the early era of U.S. expansion.

The Swahili are a Bantu ethnic group living along the Eastern Coast of Africa. From about the 9th century onwards the region, at the crossroads of Islamic and African cultural influences, saw the rise of Swahili city states, including Zanzibar, Kilwa Kisiwani, Mozambique and Sofala. The cities grew to prominence thanks to their ivory, gold, slave and spice trade. The arrival of the Portuguese around 1500 coincided with the decline of the Swahili polities, but the Swahili remained a dominant cultural element in Eastern Africa. Today, the Swahili language (Kiswahili) is used as lingua franca by more than 50 million people in Eastern Africa and is an official language of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, the Comoros and the African Union.

Though numbering the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, throughout the Caribbean, the Taino fell victim to slavery and disease, and their population declined rapidly as a result. Spanish accounts paint them as a peaceful people compared to their Carib neighbors to the south. Their dugout canoes, which were often nearly as long as Columbus' ships, ferried traders between islands. Recent genetic studies show that roughly half of Puerto Ricans have Taino maternal descent.

The Thuringians were an ancient Germanic confederation in what is now Central Germany, established after the defeat of the Huns. Defeated by the Franks in the 8th century, Thuringia later became a landgraviate of the Holy Roman Empire. After the extinction of the ruling family in the 13th century, the War of the Thuringian Succession left the region badly splintered even for Holy Roman Empire standards, which was exacerbated by the Thuringian (or rather Saxon) tradition of dividing territory amongst all male heirs. Thuringia was a hotbed of the Protestant Reformation and the Wars of Religion, and saw a cultural apogee during the Enlightenment when the duke of Saxe-Weimar invited luminaries such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller to his court. Thuringian political fragmentation survived Napoleon and the German unification; only after the fall of the German monarchies in 1918 was a united Free State of Thuringia established, which currently exists as one of the states of Germany.

The Tocharians were an Indo-European people living in what is now Xinjiang in western China. Because of their unique geopolitical position, their kingdoms of Shanshan, Kucha, and Khotan (as well as other, smaller ones) were influenced by Chinese, Persian, Indian, Sogdian, Scythian, and Tibetan cultures. Their religion, dress, writing, and art all reflect these varied influences. They lived in oasis towns and cities along the Silk Road, along which Buddhism was carried into China. The area was at various times a military protectorate of China, such as during the Han and Tang dynasties. During the decline of the latter dynasty, the Turkic Uyghur tribe moved into the Tarim basin, settling in and expanding their khanate through the Tocharian lands. The Uyghur intermarried with the Tocharians and supplanted their language for all but liturgical purposes. Even this use fell when Islam spread and took the place of Buddhism as the predominant religion in the region.

Toltec culture continued to thrive until the 12th century. Their capital Tollan was violently destroyed in 1168 and the Toltec area fragmented into rivaling city-states. Toltec cultural influences have been identified from New Mexico to Nicaragua, though historians do not agree on the political history of the Toltecs. Since most of the history of the Toltecs is based on Aztec mythology, some claim there was never a Toltec Empire, but that Aztec references to the Toltecs were an allegory for civilization.

Zhuang
</h2>

<p>
The Zhuang people live in far southwestern China, an ancient border region that has long separated Sinitic civilization from the aboriginal peoples of Southeast Asia. Known for their unique irrigation and scenic terraced rice paddies, they were under pressure from various Chinese dynasties for most of the Ancient era. By the 10th century CE the Zhuang were under harsh rule by the Chinese Song dynasty. After a rebellion in 1052 led by folk-hero Nong Zhigao was crushed, many Zhuang migrated southward forming the basis of the Lao, Thai, and Shan nations. After the Han, the Zhuang are the most populous ethnic group of the People's Republic of China.
