<h1>
Government Types
</h1>

<h2>
Overview
</h2>

<p>
Your government type influences your cities' productivity and commerce, your citizens' happiness, and many other game factors.
<br>

<br>
You start out ruling your civilization through Despotism. As your technology improves, you can select other forms of government (listed below). In order to change your form of government, you must start a revolution. This will cause your civilization to undergo a period of Anarchy (lasting 1-5 turns); at the end of this time, you will be able to choose your new government.
<br>

<br>
TIP 1:  Offensive military campaigns are difficult under Republican and Democratic governments unless you give your citizens lots of luxuries to keep them happy. When conquering other civilizations, it may be helpful to switch to one of the more militant styles of government.
<br>

<br>
TIP 2:  Scientific advancement requires high levels of trade, which are much easier to achieve under Republican and Democratic governments. Consider switching to the Republic as soon as you can; gaining advanced technology early in the game puts you at an advantage.
</p>

<h2>
Anarchy
</h2>

<p>
Anarchy is simply the absence of any recognizable government. Citizens are disorganized and unproductive, and will spend all income as quickly as possible, rather than paying taxes or conducting research.
<br>

<br>
* Buildings and technologies do not require any upkeep.
<br>

<br>
* Without Pyramids, each worked tile that gives more than 2 Food, Shield, or Trade will suffer a -1 penalty, unless the city working it is celebrating. (Cities below size 3 will not celebrate.)
<br>

<br>
* Each city can support up to 2 shield unit payment for free; further units each cost 1 (or more, in case of upgrade) shield per turn.
<br>

<br>
* Military units do not cause unhappiness even when deployed aggressively.
<br>

<br>
* Military units impose martial law. Up to 3 military units inside a city will each force 1 unhappy citizen to become satisfying.
<br>

<br>
* You have no control over tax rates. Half of the trade income is simply lost to your economy (less if you have luxury-promoting buildings), and the remainder all goes to luxuries.
<br>

<br>
* Base production and food waste is 30%.
<br>

<br>
* Luxury science outcome are halved, tax and science specialists' output is halved.
<br>

<br>
* The only Policy setting, which is taken into account is National Pride. 
<br>

<br>
Features:
<br>
* If you lose your capital, the base chance of civil war is 99%.
<br>
* You can have up to 10 cities before an additional unhappy citizen appears in each city due to civilization size.
<br>
* After the first unhappy citizen due to civilization size, for each 5 additional cities another unhappy citizen will appear.
<br>

</p>

<h2>
Tribal
</h2>

<p>
Under a Tribal government, you are part ruler of your people. Your control over your citizens is maintained largely by spiritual counsel.
<br>

<br>
Compared to Despotism, a Tribal economy is more shield-oriented, without government centre. Its bonuses to veterancy can be an advantage in wartime, but it lacks the martial law of other early governments.
<br>

<br>
* Increases by half the chance of small land, infantry and cavalry units getting the next veteran level after a battle.
<br>

<br>
* Without Pyramids, each worked tile that gives more than 2 Food, Shield, or Trade will suffer a -1 penalty, unless the city working it is celebrating or Tribe Hut exist. (Cities below size 3 will not celebrate.)
<br>

<br>
* With Pyramids, celebrating cities with Granary and size 3 or above are subject of Rapture Growth  (this effect is cancelled by Monotheism)
<br>

<br>
* Each city can support up to 2 units shield payment for free; further units each cost  shields per turn (more than 6, also food).
<br>

<br>
* Unlike later governments, military units do not cause unhappiness even when deployed aggressively.
<br>

<br>
* Base corruption and waste is 30% (the highest under any government) (half of base corruption with knowledge of Banking).
<br>

<br>
* Base food waste is 10% for all cities.
<br>

<br>
* Tribe loyality make inciting revolt 2x more expensive than Despotism or Monarchy.
<br>

<br>
* Science and gold outcome is decreased 25%, tax specialists' output is halved
<br>

<br>
* Policies settings, which are taken into account: Welfare Policy, Religious Orthodoxy, National Pride. 
<br>

<br>
Features:
<br>
* Each of your cities will avoid paying 6 upkeep for your units. (type: ðŸŒ¾)
<br>
* If you lose your capital, the base chance of civil war is 20%.
<br>
* You can have up to 8 cities before an additional unhappy citizen appears in each city due to civilization size.
<br>
* After the first unhappy citizen due to civilization size, for each 4 additional cities another unhappy citizen will appear.
<br>
* The maximum rate you can set for science, gold, or luxuries is 60%.
<br>
* Unhappiness from foreign citizens due to war with their home state is 75% the usual value.
<br>

<h2>
Thalassocracy
</h2>

<p>
