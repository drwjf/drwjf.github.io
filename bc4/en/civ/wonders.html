<h1>
World Wonders
</h1>

<h2>
Overview
</h2>

<p>
Wonders are special buildings which can each be completed by only one player each game, and which often enhance their entire civilization. Unlike ordinary city improvements, which must be built with local production points, certain special units built in one city (Caravans and Freight) can contribute their full cost in production points towards the construction of a wonder in another city.
<br>

<br>
Once built, a wonder is placed in the city that constructed it, and cannot be sold or destroyed (unless the entire city is destroyed). However, some wonders are made obsolete under certain circumstances, and lose their effect. Note the asymmetry: while you must personally achieve the advance required by each wonder to build it, it will be disabled when any player achieves the obsoleting advance.
</p>

<h2>
Apollo Program
</h2>

<p>
The entire map becomes permanently visible to the player who owns it -- the player always has up-to-date knowledge of all terrain and cities (but not units) despite fog-of-war.  It allows all players to start building spaceship parts (assuming they have researched the necessary technologies).
<br>

<br>
Completion of the Apollo Program also allows nuclear-armed powers to declare war without provocation, regardless of the existence of the United Nations, and AI players will no longer be friendly towards the owner of the United Nations or the Eiffel Tower.
