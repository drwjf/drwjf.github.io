<h1>
Military Units
</h1>

<h2>
Overview
</h2>

<p>
Units provide both the mobility your civilization needs, and the violence with which it will survive and expand. The available units may be classified as military units, whose talents are those of defense and aggression, and a few noncombatants which support expansion, diplomacy, and trade.
<br>

<br>
Units are usually built in cities using production points. Once built, units are owned by the city that built them (although they can later be re-homed while visiting a different city) and demand support from that city; this will be one of your major expenses. Most units require upkeep such as production points from their home city every turn, although some autocratic styles of government can force cities to support several units for free. If the upkeep of a unit outweighs its benefit, you can disband it; see the section on Production. A few units, particularly those that you start the game with, have no home city and thus require no upkeep.
<br>

<br>
Most units begin every turn with one or more movement points. Every action undertaken by a unit consumes movement points.
<br>

<br>
The most basic action is movement; units can move into any of the tiles surrounding their current location, subject to restrictions imposed by their physical nature (the terrain they are 'native' to), by diplomatic obligations (see the section on Diplomacy), and by enemy units (see the section on Zones of Control). The number of movement points consumed may depend on the type of terrain; see the Terrain help.
<br>

<br>
A unit cannot move onto a tile occupied by an enemy unit, and when directed to do so will attack instead (if capable of attack), locking the two units in combat until one is destroyed. The outcome depends on the attributes of the units in question (hit points, attack and defense strength, and firepower); the Combat section describes the process in detail, and the following sections list specific units' attributes.
<br>

<br>
Units' attributes can be further boosted by being veteran. Units may be built as veteran by means of certain city improvements or other influences; once built, units can also become veteran through experience (such as surviving combat), which may provide further levels of bonuses beyond those available from their initial training.
<br>

<br>
In this ruleset, the following veteran levels are defined:
<br>

<br>
Veteran level      Power factor   Move bonus
<br>
--------------------------------------------
<br>
green                      100%        -    
<br>
veteran                    150%        -    
<br>
hardened                   175%        -    
<br>
elite                      200%        -    
<br>

<br>
Units which have been damaged in combat will regain hit points each turn in which they are not moved. Normally, a unit which has not moved will regain one hit point per turn. Units which are fortified gain an extra hit point. A unit which spends a turn in a city regains one third of its base hit points, and city improvements appropriate to the unit type can improve this further. In the field, bases on tiles can improve the recovery rate (for instance, fortresses have this effect); units must stay on the tile for a whole turn to get this recovery bonus. Wonders can also boost recovery (such as the United Nations). Damaged units in Sentry mode will wake up when they have regained all of their hit points.
<br>

<br>
As technology advances, new types of units become available which obsolete existing types. When you discover such a new technology, your existing units remain intact, but you can no longer build new units of the obsolete type. While an obsolete unit is in one of your cities, you can choose to upgrade it to the latest equivalent by spending gold, with the cost increasing with the difference in production point cost between the two types. When a unit is upgraded, its hit points and movement points are preserved as a fraction of the total.

<br>

<br>
Settlers are one of the key units in the game, as they are your main means of founding new cities.
<br>

<br>
Settlers can also perform some of the same terrain alterations as Workers (but cannot build airstrips, airbases, or buoys).
<br>

<br>
TIP: optimal production of Settlers occurs in cities of at most size 4, or cities with a Granary of at most size 6.
<br>

<br>

<h2>
Migrants
</h2>

<p>
Attack/Defense/Movement: ‚öîÔ∏è0/üõ°1/üõ£1
<br>

<br>
  * Subject to zones of control.
<br>
  * Slowed down while damaged.
<br>
  * Can be airlifted from a suitable city.
<br>
* Costs 1 population to build.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Migrants can be used to transfer population to other cities, but may not found new cities. They can also perform some of the same terrain alterations as Workers (but cannot build airstrips, airbases, or buoys).
<br>

<br>
TIP: Migrants can be a good alternative to Workers in overpopulated cities, as they benefit from free food upkeep.

<br>
Engineers are similar to Workers, but they work twice as fast, move twice as fast, and may gain experience from work enabling them to work even faster.
<br>

<br>
With knowledge of Fusion Power, Engineers may also perform more radical terrain transformations than Workers, Settlers, or Migrants, with the "transform" order. Examples include conversion of Tundra into Plains, or even Ocean into Swamp in some circumstances (when on board an ocean-going vessel, on a tile surrounded by sufficient existing land). See the Terrain Alterations section for more details.

Chariots are horse-pulled war wagons. They have a stronger attack than Horsemen, but their speed comes at a cost: they are more expensive to build, they cannot take advantage of terrain to defend themselves, they cannot move in rough terrain (mountains, swamps, and jungles) without roads, and they cannot be transported by sea using early ships (Triremes and Caravels).

Catapults are large rock-throwing machines of war. They are very strong attackers but equally weak defenders and will need an escort to be effective.
<br>

<br>
While powerful, Catapults (and their successors) are bulky and awkward; they require roads to move in rough terrain (mountains, swamps, and jungles), are difficult to defend, and are too big for early ships (Triremes and Caravels).

Helicopters can also transport one military land unit; while most troops must load or unload in a city, airstrip, or airbase (and not in the field or onboard a Carrier), units specializing in mobility (Paratroopers, Alpine Troops, Marines, Partisans, and Fanatics) can embark or disembark at any time.
<br>

<br>
Unlike other aircraft, Helicopters are not required to return to a city, base, or Carrier to refuel after a set number of turns; however, care must be exercised, due to the health they lose every turn.

<br>
You can build Nuclear units when you have the required advance, and the Manhattan Project wonder has been built by any player. However, without further technology they cannot move on their own.
<br>

<br>
With Advanced Flight, all Nuclear units (including those already built) gain a range of 8 movement points, and Rocketry increases this to 16.
<br>

<br>
On impact, the blast will destroy any unit in an area 3 tiles wide (3x3 squares for rectangular grids), including friendly units. Any city within the blast area loses half its population, and land tiles within the blast area are subject to nuclear fallout.
<br>

<br>
Nuclear fallout reduces tile output and increases the risk of global nuclear winter; see the help on Fallout.
<br>

<br>
TIP:  You may be involved in a situation where you've invaded an enemy country en masse, but the enemy cities are too strong. Before using a Nuclear unit, assemble a gang of cleanup units next to the city and have them ready to fix the fallout on the same turn it occurs! This minimizes the chance of nuclear winter. Eco-friendly nukes!

<br>

<br>
A Diplomat is an official that carries your dispatches and is authorized to deal with foreign dignitaries. He may also undertake various covert operations with the intent of harming your opponents; Diplomats in your own cities defend them against such actions.
<br>

<br>
Many covert actions may be attempted even in peacetime, but the more aggressive actions will be discovered and cause diplomatic incidents, giving an excuse for the breaking of treaties by a Federation or Democracy, or a nuclear-armed regime otherwise restrained by the United Nations.
<br>

<br>
If a foreign unit is alone on a tile, you may attempt to bribe it with your Diplomat. By paying a sum of gold the unit will immediately become yours; the exact sum depends on the status of the unit and that of the civilization owning it. However, units belonging to Republican or Democratic governments cannot be bribed. Bribery when not at war will cause a diplomatic incident.
<br>

<br>
Diplomats can also perform a number of actions in another player's city, although each Diplomat may attempt only one action. Most of these actions have a chance of failure. Also, any enemy Diplomats or Spies in the city will oppose hostile actions, as will the enemy Leader in games with leaders; in this case, either your unit or the defending unit will die (if you go up against the Leader you will always die). If the defending unit dies, you lose one movement point and may try again.
<br>

<br>
The actions available to Diplomats in a city are:
<br>

<br>
 - "Establish Embassy": This action always succeeds, and gives permanent contact with the city's owner, as well as intelligence on their tax rates and technology. Each player you have an embassy with that knows a technology reduces that technology's research cost to you.
<br>

<br>
 - "Investigate City": Your unit attempts to report detailed information about the city: its status, what buildings and units are within, and what it is currently producing.
<br>

<br>
 - "Sabotage City": Your unit attempts either to disrupt all the city's work so far towards its current project, or to destroy an existing building in the city, at random. Once built, Palaces and Wonders cannot be sabotaged, and attempts to sabotage City Walls or any building in a capital each halve the chance of success. Sabotage may only be attempted when openly at war.
<br>

<br>
 - "Steal Technology": Your unit attempts to learn the secrets of a random technology known to the city's owner but not to you. Technology may only be stolen once from a given enemy city by Diplomats. This action may be attempted even when not at war, but will cause a diplomatic incident.
<br>

<br>
 - "Incite a Revolt": In return for gold a foreign city will change allegiance and join your empire, bringing along all nearby units that call it home, but reducing its size by 1. Units in other cities remain in the enemy's control, but units outside cities are lost to both players. The exact sum depends on the status of the city and that of the civilization that owns it. It is not possible to incite a rebellion in a capital, or in any city governed by a Federation or Democracy. Incitement may be attempted in peacetime, but will cause a diplomatic incident.
<br>

<br>
In some game strategies, hordes of Diplomats can be used to wreak havoc on the enemy.  Little wonder that Diplomats are often viewed with suspicion and fear!
<br>

<br>
Diplomats built under Communist or Federation governments will start at the first veteran level (secretary).

A Spy is more skilled in the arts of espionage than her Diplomat predecessor.
<br>

<br>
She can perform all the functions of the Diplomat; refer to the Diplomat entry for more details. Unlike a Diplomat, a Spy may also survive an operation in a foreign city and become more experienced as a result. Spies are also more effective than Diplomats at defending cities against foreign Diplomats and Spies.
<br>

<br>
A Spy can also be used to:
<br>

<br>
 - sabotage an enemy unit (reducing its hit points to half), if it is alone on a tile and the players are at war; 
<br>

<br>
 - poison the water supply of an enemy city (reducing the population by one); 
<br>

<br>
 - steal specific technology (with a reduced chance of success); 
<br>

<br>
 - steal further technologies from a city which has already been stolen from (although cities become more resistant each time they are stolen from); 
<br>

<br>
 - sabotage predetermined city targets (with a reduced chance of success).
<br>

<br>
A Spy that survives the more aggressive actions (sabotage, theft, inciting rebellion, and poisoning) escapes to the safety of the nearest friendly city.

<br>
A Caravan carries goods or material for trading with other nations, or to help build wonders in your own cities.
<br>

<br>
Caravans cannot take advantage of maglevs, but may travel on the railroads that accompany them.
<br>

<br>
A Caravan sent to a foreign city (one not owned by an enemy) can establish a trade route. The route's ongoing revenue is doubled if the two cities involved are on different continents. Each city can support a maximum of two trade routes.
<br>

<br>
A Caravan sent to one of your own cities that is building a wonder can add 50 shields towards its production. If your city is not building a wonder, the Caravan can take no special action.
<br>

<br>
TIP:  You can stockpile a stack of Caravans in advance and bring them all into a city where you have started to build a wonder, and finish it in only one turn!

Explorers can also perform some actions in another player's city, although the unit disappears after the action is complete.
<br>

<br>
 - "Establish Embassy": This action always succeeds, and gives permanent contact with the city's owner, as well as intelligence on their tax rates and technology. Each player you have an embassy with that knows a technology reduces that technology's research cost to you.
<br>

<br>
 - "Investigate City": Your unit attempts to report detailed information about the city: its status, what buildings and units are within, and what it is currently producing.
