    <h1>Can you play Civ on mobile?</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Yes, you can try BC4000 App. Take the role of tribal leader in 4000 B.C., move units on the map, build or improve new cities and units, and choose technologies to research to enable new building skills turn by turn.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        BC4000 is a single player, turn-based strategy game for iOS platform inspired by the Sid Meier's Civilization
        series.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Player take the role of tribal leaders in 4000 B.C., compete against AI opponents to found cities, support
        military and economy, and finally to complete an empire that survives all encounters with its neighbors to
        emerge victorious. To construct new city buildings and deploy of new units, new technologies should be
        discovered. You can wage war on one another or form diplomatic relationships with AI opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
        Achieving success requires a balance between economic expansion, military strength, and technological
        development. Not only must you develop all three in concert to both expand and successfully defend your empire,
        but any of the three may provide victory over your opponents:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            As in other games of conquest and expansion, you are declared the winner by default once the last city and
            unit of every other civilization is destroyed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once technological progress has brought you into the space age, you may launch a spacecraft destined for
            Alpha Centauri; the
            first civilization whose craft reaches the system wins.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the absence of other means to determine victory, the game will end after 5000 turns if no spacecraft have
            yet been launched. The surviving civilizations are then rated, and the one with the highest score is the
            winner.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strategy and Tactics</h2>

    <p>
        While every game is different, there's a basic strategy which most players follow, especially at the start
        of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, the steps are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Choosing the first city site.
            <p>
                Start the game by wandering around BRIEFLY to find a good place to build the first city. Don't feel
                tempted to investigate any yellow-roofed villages yet - they might contain barbarian tribes. Build the
                city close to resources and perhaps close to the sea. Keep in mind that the city you build first will be
                your capital! The idea is to balance the quality of the site you find against getting your first city
                established as early as possible.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Mapping the countryside.
            <p>
                After the capital city has been founded, it will start producing a warrior unit. These units can be used
                to rove around exploring the countryside. Remember, it is risky to leave a city undefended, so perhaps
                keep the first warrior in the city, and use the following one to explore. If you started the game with
                an explorer unit, use that to explore, obviously!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Defending the cities.
            <p>
                At this point, defend your cities by always leaving a warrior unit in them. As your civilization
                develops units with a greater defense strength, replace the obsolete units with new ones to ensure your
                cities have maximum defense. The units most often used for defense are (in order of strength): Warrior,
                Phalanx, Pikemen, Musketeers, and Riflemen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep in mind that with some types of government, military units inside or outside cities can reduce or
                create unhappiness. Also remember that when a land unit is inside a city, it gets a 50% defensive bonus,
                as if fortified. When a new city is built, the city starts to build the best available defensive unit
                from the above list.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Deciding which units to build first.
            <p>
                After building one or two Warrior units, start building Settlers. Settlers take city population, but if
                you picked a good city site, your city should be big enough by now. Settlers are best put to use
                founding new cities; while they can also build agricultural improvements (see the next section), it is
                better to use Workers for this when available, as unlike Settlers, Workers do not consume food from
                their parent city. Keep in mind that a large population increases both the amount of productivity and
                your civilization's research rate, not to mention that cities secure land for your empire, so founding
                new cities should be a high priority initially.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Improving the land.
            <p>
                Each city has an area of land around it that can be used for growing food, producing goods, and
                generating trade. This output can be increased by using Workers (or Settlers) to improve the land close
                to your cities. The land can be improved with irrigation (increasing food), roads (allowing units to
                move faster and increasing trade), and mines (increasing production), among other improvements.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Deciding where to build cities.
            <p>
                The best location for a city is a matter of taste. A city which is placed near the sea is easier to spot
                by opponents, but can also serve as a port for sea-going units. (They also usually need a coastal
                defense later on.) The best strategy is to build a few of both, but keep in mind that your opponents
                will find it harder to locate your city if you don't build it by the sea.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Taking care of the cities.
            <p>
                Every city has a band of citizens. The number of citizens depends on the city's population. When you tap
                on a city, you can see how the land around the city is being used. You can assign your citizens to the
                land, or they can be specialists that contribute to your civilization in other ways. Especially at the
                start of the game, care should be taken to ensure that the citizens are employed so that they maximize
                growth, trade and production.
            </p>
            <p>
                If too much food is being generated, a citizen can be taken off the land by tapping on the occupied land
                tile. This citizen can then be transferred to the other duties mentioned previously.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you tap on the central tile of the land, the citizens will be rearranged to maximize food output.
            </p>
            <p>
                The golden rule of taking care of a city is that there should be at least as many happy citizens as
                unhappy citizens. A city where this is not so falls into disorder; such cities are labeled with a raised
                fist or a lightning bolt (depending on the tileset). Take care not to let this happen to any of your
                cities, as cities in disorder produce nothing, and are prone to revolt.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Interacting with other players (diplomacy).
            <p>
                When one of your units first meets a unit of another nation, or finds one of their cities (or equally if
                they find you), a basic contact is established between the two nations. This provides each with basic
                intelligence about the other, which can be accessed from the 'Nations' report.
            </p>
            <p>
                This communication will lapse after a set number of turns with no contact. Establishing an embassy will
                give a more permanent communication channel, as well as more advanced intelligence such as details of
                technology. Embassies are one-way - the nation hosting the embassy receives no benefit - and once
                established, cannot be revoked.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are in contact with another player, then you can arrange a diplomatic meeting. From the
                'World/Diplomacy/Status' report, this is done by tapping on the nation with whom you wish to meet and
                selecting 'Meet'. A treaty dialog will pop up.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this dialog you can negotiate an exchange of assets (maps, vision, advances, cities, or gold),
                embassies, or binding pacts such as a cease-fire or peace. There is no need to trade like for like; you
                can trade, say, an advance or city for gold - you can consider this buying and selling. Each player
                builds a list of offered items. To remove an item from the list, tap on it. When both players indicate
                satisfaction, the pact is concluded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pacts affect where your units can go and what they can do, and a pact with one nation can affect your
                relations with others. Under authoritarian governments such as Monarchy you can break a pact at any
                time, but the representative governments (Republic and Democracy) have a senate which will block the
                unprovoked cancelation of a treaty; unless a foreign Diplomat or Spy sparks a diplomatic incident, the
                only way to dissolve a pact in this situation is to dissolve your government. The details of pacts are
                described in the Diplomacy section.
            </p>
            <p>
                A couple of notes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can't give away your capital.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can only request property that you know about; so you can't request technology unless you have
                    an embassy, and if you can't see a city on your map, then you can't request it. Of course, the owner
                    of that city can still offer it to you, in which case the area around the city is shown on your map
                    before you accept the treaty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One important thing to note: when a city is transferred, any units in the field and supported by
                    that city are also transferred (but not those sitting in other cities). So make sure the other
                    player isn't getting a better deal than you expect.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Exploring the world.
            <p>
                After you have fortified your cities with troops, build Triremes in the cities near the sea. Use the
                Triremes to map the world in search of opponents and new lands. If you are on an island, you should
                spend less on military and more on expansion. Or if you are located close to an opponent, it is truly a
                good idea to make a peace treaty and share the advances you have made. Diplomatic units are very useful
                here, and WILL pay off later.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Things to keep in mind.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What the next advance you'll need is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What your tax, luxury and research rates are currently set to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Treaties are often broken, so don't neglect defense...
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some wonders can be made obsolete.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Making your own strategy for the game.
            <p>
                These basic concepts will allow you to play the game pretty
                well, especially in the beginning of the game. But to improve,
                you need to study the various units and advances, and PRACTICE,
                PRACTICE, PRACTICE!
            </p>

    </ol>


    <h2>Guide</h2>

    <p>
        To use this guide, one must have a firm grasp and understanding of the mechanics of BC4000. Make every turn
        count, for placing a unit in the wrong place and time can bring the end of your civilization. Follow these
        steps and win every time. This guide only accounts for winning by military conquest, not by reaching Alpha
        Centauri.
    </p>
    <h3>Settlement Era</h3>
    <p>
        By default you should start with some settlers, workers, and an explorer. Your explorer is key to the first
        moments of your nation. It'll help scope out for good land to settle on, find other AIs, and enter tribal
        huts. Try to make this unit survive as long as possible, and if you come across a friendly mercenary Legion,
        use them to enter huts for some contain barbarians that'll kill the unit.
    </p>
    <p>After moving the Explorer, select a Settler and place it on a good settling spot to build a city. A good
        place to put a city would be on a special tile, in an area with many specials surrounding it, on grassland,
        or on the coast. After building your first city, immediately start producing Settlers. If the production of
        Settlers out paces it growth to becoming size 3, then produce coins until building settlers matches the
        number it'll take to grow. In the Research page, set the technology goal to Alphabet. Wait to see if there
        are other players on your continent before choosing a higher technology to research.
    </p>
    <p>Continuously build settlers until most of the available land is taken. If you are not alone, use your
        explorer to block other settlers away form unclaimed land until you build on it. After building as many
        cities as possible, use other settlers as workers to change the land around cities farthest away from the
        capital.
    </p>
    <p>Use the workers to irrigate plains and grasslands around cities, then build roads to add trade points. After
        that, use them to change Swamps and Jungles into either Grasslands or Forests. If a city has many forest
        tiles around it, turn them into plains then irrigate them. Having two workers on the same tile speeds up the
        transformation. After all the work is done and you decide to move the workers to another city, have them
        build a road on the way to the city. Building roads along Deserts, Plains, and Grasslands are faster than on
        hills, forests, and
        Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>If you are on a small continent or island, set Map Making as the very first goal. Build Triremes to find more
        land to settle on.
    </p>
    <p>If you come in contact with another player at this point, go ahead and set the tech goal to Monarchy. If
        otherwise skip the next section and research Trade.
    </p>
    <h3>The Kingdom</h3>
    <p>Becoming a Monarchy is key if you start a war with other nation early in the game. Monarchy governments were
        built for war, and have a slightly higher Tax Limit, allowing for more research.
    </p>
    <p>If neighbours around you have a friendly attitude towards you, skip to the next section and research trade.
        Otherwise, after establishing the Monarchy, set the new tech goal to Iron Working.
    </p>
    <p>The key here is to eliminate all hostile nations for the sake of your existence. Try to make a war end as
        fast as possible for it can give the enemy time to catch up technologically and hinder your progress.
    </p>
    <p>Go to Tax Rates and set Science to 70% once the new government is established. Then set the tech goals as
        followed:
    </p>
    <p>Iron Working -> Mathematics -> Chivalry
    </p>
    <p>Legionnaires act as defensive and skirmishing units, able to withstand an attack from enemy Archers and have
        high enough attack points to destroy them. Catapults will be your main attacking force against walled
        cities. First amass a group of 5+ Catapults before sending them to attack an enemy city. Be sure they are
        defended since by Knights or Legions for they have a very low defence. Once Chivalry is discovered, stop
        producing
        Legion and start producing Knights, for they have more movement points.
    </p>
    <p>Have your frontier cities and the capital walled and build Barracks, for they will be the ones building the
        units. Other cities far from the action should produce coins as to not go into debt.
    </p>
    <p>If the war ends or you discover Chivalry, go on to the next section. Make sure to disband all military units
        after all hostile nations have been taken care of.
    </p>
    <h3>Age of Trade</h3>
    <p>This is the period of time is about establishing trade routes between cities and building a strong economy as
        to ease the Burden of low Tax and Luxury percentages. While researching Trade, make Currency a priority.
        It'll allow for Marketplaces to be built in your cities, increasing gold and luxuries in the city. By the
        time all cities have built a Marketplace, Trade should already be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>Tap 'City Control' / 'Trade Route Overview' to show the trade routes established by each city and tell you
        when the city will reach its max trade limit (4). Have half of your cities produce Caravans and others
        produce Coinage or Temples (if allowed). By Producing trade routes and entering a city's marketplace, you gain
        gold and research points. A trade route cannot be established with other cities up to 6 tiles away.
    </p>
    <p>After Trade is researched, set the tech goal to Republic. Once Literacy is learned, have the city with the
        highest production to build the Great Library Wonder and other cities build Caravans to help build it.
    </p>
    <p>Make sure that during the era, your cities do no grow too big. The more the city increases, the more unhappy
        citizens there will be and higher chance of there being a revolt. Slow down or completely stunt their growth
        by going to the City page. On the small map where it shows the resources being used by the city. Reallocate
        workers to tiles that produce more shields than food, or just dont choose another tile at all. By doing the
        later, those workers who would otherwise be working become entertainers and help keep your citizens happy and
        satisfied. Don't allow a city to grow beyond 6, unless they have a temple, in which case the limit is 8.
    </p>
    <h3>The Republic</h3>
    <p>Once you have researched Republic, immediately change your government to the Republic. Set science tax rates
        to Max once again and set the Tech goal to Democracy, having Banking as a priority. If a city reaches its
        trade route limit, have it build banks and other cities build Caravans to reach their limit.
    </p>
    <p>Do not build Aqueducts, Colosseums, or anything with a an upkeep of 1 (except for temples) yet. Try not to
        get into any Alliances or wars, Be as peaceful as possible until the Modern Age.
    </p>
    <p> - Building Up
    </p>
    <p>Once Democracy is discovered, do not start a revolution just yet. there are 3 significant wonders that'll put
        you ahead for the rest of the game. Those would be Michelangelo's Chapel, J.S Bach's, and A. Smith Trading
        Co.
    </p>
    <p>Set the goal to either Theology or Economy first. Build the wonders as soon as they are available, and have
        surrounding cities build caravans as to complete it as fast as possible. Once all three are built start to
        build up.
    </p>
    <p>The Chapels make unhappy citizens satisfied, allowing for your cities to grow. Build aqueducts where they are
        immediately needed, build Libraries where it isn't the case. A. Smith's will allow buildings with an upkeep
        of 1 to be free of cost, taking a heavy load off the small tax burden.
    </p>
    <p>Set the goal to Industry once Economy and Theology are discovered.
    </p>
    <h3>The Industrial Era</h3>
    <p>Once Railroad is discovered, start replacing connecting roads with Railroads. Also start building the
        Darwin's Voyage wonder, but don't build Caravans to help advance its production.
    </p>
    <p>Once Industrialisation is discovered, do not start building Factories just yet. Set the new Tech goal to
        Electricity. Darwin's Voyage should be built during this time, so you'll be able to learn it quicker. Once
        discovered, build the Hoover Dam Wonder as fast as possible.
    </p>
    <p>After completion, start building Factories in the biggest of cities and work down. Set the new Tech goal to
        either Explosives or Recycling. Pollution will soon pose a serious problem so be prepared for it.
    </p>
    <p>Change your government to a Democracy when ever you please, but note that you can not change the Tax Rates to
        have max Science. Also it is a lot harder to appease the people, so after the revolution, it would be best
        to set Luxury rates to 10%
    </p>
    <h3>Building Up Part 2</h3>
    </p>
    <p>It is very Important that you control the pollution that your cities produce. Having too much pollution will
        cause global warming and can flood precious tiles or turn tiles into useless ones like Jungles or Swamps.
        Keep your civilisation clean by building Mass Transits, Recycling Centers, and later, Solar Plants. Also have
        Workers or Engineers on alert to clean up pollution as soon as it pops up. Place these units on the railroad
        connecting your cities to address the problem as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>After Explosives have been discovered, upgrade all workers and start amassing an army of Engineers.
        Concentrate all Engineers on one tile to transform Deserts, Hills, Tundras, and Mountains around the cities
        into Plains that can be irrigated. Leave one Engineer to work on the transformed tile while the others transform
        more tiles.
    </p>
    <p>Set the Tech goal to Refrigeration. Build Sewer Systems where needed. Have Engineers turn irrigated land into
        Farmland when available. Build the Supermarket as soon as you can. Build Offshore Oil Rigs in cities on the
        coast.
    </p>
    <p>During this time, your population is going to skyrocket. Not only that, but all of the buildings mentioned in
        this section are very expensive. Both tax and Luxury percentages may have to increase in order to accommodate
        the growing population. To keep the research going at the same pace, build Universities and
        Wonders that increase science.
    </p>
    <p>Once Engineers have flattened the land around all of your cities, disband all but a few in order to keep up
        with some pollution
    </p>
    <h3>The Modern Era</h3>
    <p>By now, you should be a thousand years ahead of all most all players. Once all necessary technology has been
        taken care of, it's time to start building a massive army.
    </p>
    <p>Set Tech goals as follows
    </p>
    <p>Combined Arms -> Robotics -> Rocketry
    </p>
    <p>While researching these goals, lower the science tax rates little by little and put it into Luxury . Research
        speed will hardly be effected, and people will start to celebrate at around 30% Luxury rates. Having happy
        citizens is crucial to building an army in a Democratic state. Build Wonders like the Cure for Cancer or
        Shakespeare's Theater to help keep people happy and satisfied. Build the Statue of Liberty so that way you
        can dissolve the Senate and declare war on who ever you please, then return to a democratic state on the same
        turn.
    </p>
    <p>Build Barracks III in all cities, Airports in a few and Port Facilities in others. Bomb enemy cities with
        bombers carried by Carriers, invade them with a helicopter if there isn't a unit left in that city. Have
        transports carry armies of Tanks and Howitzers to enemy territory and start a Blitzkrieg.
    </p>
    <p>After Rocketry, let the research handle itself and put the science rate at 10%. Once you start researching
        Future Techs, set science to 0%
    </p>
    <p>At this point, you will be able to conquer the world and be the only player left standing. Note that Playing
        BC4000 is very tedious, sometimes requiring many days before finishing. Be patient and make careful
        decisions.
