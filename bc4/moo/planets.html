        Planets
    </h1>
    <p>
    Each star system has (up to) one single colonizable planet. The planetary environments that can be encountered are:
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Terran planets are earth-like and can support the largest number of colonists.
        </li>
        <li>
            Jungle planets are young, undeveloped worlds reminiscent of the Age of Dinosaurs on earth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ocean planets have very few land masses and are almost completely covered by water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arid planets have only about one-quarter of their surface covered by water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Steppe planets have rugged terrains that are difficult to clear for a colony.
        </li>
        <li>
            Desert planets have very scarce water supplies and are plagued by violent dust storms.
        </li>
        <li>
            Minimal planets can barely support life with an oxygen-poor atmosphere and little water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Barren planets have no surface water supplies and little to no atmosphere.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tundra planets are basically huge balls of ice with sub-zero temperatures year-round.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dead planets have no water supplies or atmospheres whatsoever.
        </li>
        <li>
            Inferno planets are similar to Venus with excruciatingly hot environments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toxic planets have corrosive atmospheres which destroy most types of equipment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Radiated planets are constantly bombarded by solar radiation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Terraforming allows you to gradually improve a colonized planet's environment. In addition, planets can have special modifiers:
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Mineral Poor planets lack sufficient amounts of the heavy metals necessary for construction. Ship production, missile base construction, and new factory construction are halved. However, ecology and research are unaffected.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ultra Poor planets are the same as mineral poor planets, but production is reduced to one-third.
        </li>
        <li>
            Artifact planets have relics and devices left by ancient races. Your scouts may discover new technology there. Research spending at artifact colonies is also twice as effective.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mineral Rich planets have abundant supplies of heavy metals. Starship production, missile base production, and new factory construction are all doubled on mineral rich planets. Ecology and technology research is unaffected.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ultra Rich planets are the same as mineral rich planets except that production is tripled.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hostile planets have harsh environments that halve the normal population growth rate and require advanced technology to even land on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fertile planets are easier to colonize than normal. Population growth is 1.5 times normal.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gaia planets are ecological paradises. Population growth is twice normal rate.
        </li>
    </ul>
