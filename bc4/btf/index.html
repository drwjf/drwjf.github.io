<title>BC4000 - Battlefield Mode</title>
<body style="font: -apple-system-body; margin: 20px;">
    <h3>BC4000 - Battlefield Mode</h3>
    <p>Battlefield is a hex-based tactical war game in the tradition of Blue Byte's Battle Isle â„¢.

    <p>Players command their units on a map of hexagons, trying to accomplish mission objectives ranging from defending important locations to simply destroying all enemy forces. Damaged units may be repaired or replaced by new recruits, while victorious squadrons will improve their abilities so they will be even more difficult to beat next time. Each tile can be made of a different terrain. Different units have different degrees of mobility in different terrain. For example, tanks can move quickly on roads, slowly in forests, and cannot move at all on water.
