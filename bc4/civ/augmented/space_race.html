Space Race

<h2>
Space Race
</h2>

<p>
The Space Race is a second option to win the game, besides eliminating all other civilizations. If your spaceship arrives first at Alpha Centauri, the game is over and you have won. 
<br>

<br>
Before you can build spaceship parts, the Apollo Program wonder must have been built by any player. You also need specific technologies to build the different spaceship parts: see the help texts for Space Structural, Space Component, and Space Module, under City Improvements.
<br>

<br>
If the success probability is below 100%, some fraction of the people on board may not survive the journey. This reduces the score bonus from the spaceship, but it still counts as a win.
<br>

<br>
If the capital of a civilization is captured, a spaceship that has been launched will be lost, so defend your capital well!
<br>

<br>
TIP:  If an enemy civilization has launched a spaceship, try to quickly build a light spaceship with many propulsion units that will arrive earlier. The only other option is to capture their capital.
