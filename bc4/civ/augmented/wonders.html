<h1>
World Wonders
</h1>

<h2>
Overview
</h2>

<p>
Wonders are special buildings which can each be completed by only one player each game, and which often enhance their entire civilization. Unlike ordinary city improvements, which must be built with local production points, certain special units built in one city (Caravans and Freight) can contribute their full cost in production points towards the construction of a wonder in another city.
<br>

<br>
Once built, a wonder is placed in the city that constructed it, and cannot be sold or destroyed (unless the entire city is destroyed). However, some wonders are made obsolete under certain circumstances, and lose their effect. Note the asymmetry: while you must personally achieve the advance required by each wonder to build it, it will be disabled when any player achieves the obsoleting advance.
