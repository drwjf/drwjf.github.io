<h1>
City Improvements
</h1>

<h2>
Overview
</h2>

<p>
Cities may be improved with a wide variety of buildings, each with a different effect. Each city may have only one of each improvement, and some improvements require others to have been built first.
<br>

<br>
It costs production points to build improvements, and once completed, many improvements require an upkeep of one or more gold pieces per turn. You may dismantle and sell an improvement, receiving one gold piece for each production point used in its construction, although you may only sell one improvement per city per turn. If a turn comes on which you cannot pay the upkeep on all of your improvements, some of them will be automatically sold; obviously this should be avoided as the improvements chosen might not be ones you would have preferred to sell.
<br>

<br>
Most improvements become available only when you achieve certain technologies, and some improvements can become obsolete, at which point they are automatically sold.
</p>

<h2>
Tribe Hut
</h2>

<p>
New settlements that build the Tribe Hut can produce Tribe units. The Tribe Hut gives improved tile production when in Tribalism goverment (no tile penalty). You can replace Tribe Hut with City Hall to increase town influence/vision radius, but at the expense of Tribe Hut bonus.
<br>

<br>
Prevented by City Hall in the city.
<br>

<br>
* The discovery of Bronze Working will make it obsolete.
<br>
* The presence of City Hall in the city will make it obsolete.
<br>
* Allows Tribe.
<br>

</p>

<h2>
Airport
</h2>

<p>
Airports allow a city to produce veteran air units (including helicopters and missiles). Damaged air units which stay in town for one full turn without moving are completely restored.
<br>

<br>
Two cities with Airports can airlift one unit per turn (including aircraft). Airlifting instantly transports the unit from one city to another and will use all of the unit's movement points. A unit must have some movement points left to be airlifted, and cannot carry cargo.
<br>

<br>
Airport increases the city vision radius.
<br>

<br>
Requires knowledge of the technology Radar.
<br>

<br>
* Allows (with Space Flight) to build units:Jetliner

</p>

<h2>
Aqueduct
</h2>

<p>
Allows a city to grow larger than size 8.  See Sewer System.
<br>

<br>
These larger cities enjoy increased defense (+50%) against both land and sea units, however such large settlements have a small risk of fire, which can destroy buildings in the city.
<br>

<br>
Starting at size 5, growing cities incur an increasing risk of plague due to overcrowding. An Aqueduct reduces that base chance by 10%.
<br>

<br>
Building an Aqueduct in a city without adjancent tile access to a lake or river requires knowledge of Construction and at least one irrigated tile within city radius. These Aqueducts cost more to build and maintain.
<br>

<br>

<h2>
Bunkers
</h2>

<p>
The Bunkers fortification makes it easier to defend a city. They add a 100% bonus to the intrinsic defense strength of units within the city against bombs, missiles and land units (including plunging fire artillery), but are ineffective against airborne and sea units. Bunkers also prevent the loss of population which occurs when a defending unit is defeated, except of attack performed by Air units. Unlike City Walls, Bunkers do not restrict city growth.
<br>

<br>
Requires knowledge of the technology Concrete.
<br>

<br>
* Prevents to build City Walls.
<br>
* Prevents to build Palisade.
<br>

</p>

<h2>
Cathedral
</h2>

<p>
A Cathedral makes 3 unhappy citizens satisfying in a city. The addition of Michelangelo's Chapel (ally great wonder) increases the number of unhappy to satisfying citizens to 6 (e.g. doubles the effect of Cathedral). This makes it easier to maintain order in that city, however it does not affect citizens made unhappy by aggression.  The addition of J.S. Bach's Cathedral (small wonder) brings 2 additional luxury points, except when in Communism government.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
This facility increases significantly the rate of pollution caused by production.
<br>

<br>
With sufficient shield production, cities with a Cement Plant can produce up to two units each turn, but only a single unit of types which cost population.
<br>

<br>
Note: Cement Plant requires mountains within city range and cannot be built in a city, where the Research Lab is located.
<br>

<br>

<br>
* Prevents to build Taj Mahal.
<br>

</p>

<h2>
City Walls
</h2>

<p>
City Walls make it easier to defend a city. They add a 100% bonus to the intrinsic defense strength of units within the city against land units (that is a two-thirds increase for small cities, or a one-half increase for cities larger than size 8), but are ineffective against airborne, sea units or plunging fire artillery. City Walls also prevent the loss of population which occurs when a defending unit is defeated, except of attacks performed by Air units or plunging fire artillery.
<br>

<br>
City Walls need to be dismantled to allow city growth beyond size of 48. For larger cities use Bunkers.
<br>

<br>
Increases the vision range of the occupied city.

<br>

<br>
Requires knowledge of the technology Metallurgy.
<br>
Requires Oceanic terrain on the tile or an adjacent tile.
<br>

<br>

</p>

<h2>
Courthouse
</h2>

<p>
The Courthouse halves corruption and production waste in a city. In your capital or second capital, together with Post Office, corruption and waste is eliminated.
<br>

<br>
Courthouse makes one unhappy citizen satisfying (unless that citizen is unhappy about military activity), and makes the revolt cost of the city 4 times larger.
<br>

<br>
Additional unhappy citizen satisfying with Slavery Abolition for city ruled by Republic, Federation or Democracy.
<br>

<br>
Food waste is halved in city ruled by Despotism (and eliminated entirely with Granary and Windmill/Watermill/Supermarket).

This improvement is mandatory for cities above size 48.
<br>

<br>
Requires knowledge of the technology Electricity.
<br>
Requires Water Treatment in the city.
<br>

<br>

</p>

<h2>
Granary
</h2>

<p>
The Granary decreases food waste in the city as it grows. When any small city grows or shrinks, 10 food points are saved instead of wasted. This helps cities to grow faster and more easily withstand famine. With a Granary this benefit is extended to cities of size 4 and above. Ten food points is half of what a small city needs to grow, but more points are needed for later growth steps.
<br>

<br>
A Granary also halves the food wasted in cities far from your capital. Together with a Windmill/Watermill/Supermarket it eliminates food waste, except of Despotism where Courthouse is also required.
<br>

<br>
TIP1: To maximize the speed with which a city grows, you should build a Granary before it grows larger than size 4.
<br>

<br>
TIP2: Granary is mandatory for Rapture growth under First Republic, Direct Democracy or Legalism governments.
<br>

<br>
Requires knowledge of the technology Pottery.
<br>

<br>

</p>

<h2>

Building a Harbor gives one extra food resource on shallow Ocean tiles, but not Lakes. The city needs to be coastal (e.g. adjacent to Ocean tiles) to build this improvement. City with Lighthouse gain extra food also from Deep Ocean tiles.
<br>

<br>
All ships are repaired 50% faster in a city where Harbor exits.
<br>

<br>
In case of Thalassocracy goverment, any new Sea unit built in a city with Harbor have Veteran status.
<br>

<br>
Tip: Port Facility is an improved version of the Harbor.

<br>

<br>
* Allows to build Mobile X-ray (with Radioactivity and Culture 6200).
<br>

</p>

<h2>
Hydro Plant
</h2>

<p>
Any kind of electrical plant increases the shield production effect of any Factory or Mfg. Plant in its city by 25% each. Thus, an electrical plant in combination with either a Factory or a Mfg. Plant gives a 50% production bonus over the level without any of these improvements. An electrical plant, Factory, and Mfg. Plant together give a 100% production bonus. The extra production will lead to the city generating more pollution.
<br>

<br>
However, a Hydro Plant also reduces the pollution associated with shield production to 50% of its normal value, or 25% in combination with a Recycling Center. Pollution is reduced further for the player who owns the Hoover Dam (small wonder).  A Hydro Plant's effect is the same as that of a Nuclear Plant; with the Hoover Dam, its effect is increased to that of a Solar Plant.
<br>

<br>
In each city, only one Power Plant, Hydro Plant, Nuclear Plant, or Solar Plant can take effect at any one time.
<br>

<br>
Requires knowledge of the technology Turbine.
<br>
Requires Factory in the city.
<br>
Requires River on the tile or an adjacent tile.
<br>

<br>

<br>
This increase in production may slightly contribute to pollution. A Manufacture also increases the pollution caused by the population of the city.
<br>

<br>
Requires knowledge of the technology Craft Guilds.
<br>

<br>
* The discovery of The Corporation will make it obsolete.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Requires knowledge of the technology Mass Production.
<br>
Requires Railway Station in the city.
<br>

<br>

</p>

<h2>
Mfg. Plant
</h2>

<p>
The Manufacturing Plant increases the shield production in a city by an additional 25%, or 50% with an electrical plant of any kind in the same city. This effect is cumulative with that of a Factory.
<br>

<br>
With sufficient shield production, cities with a Mfg. Plant can produce up to two units each turn, but only a single unit of types which cost population.
<br>

<br>
This increase in shield production will contribute significantly to pollution
<br>

<br>
A Manufacturing Plant also has a small risk of suffering an industrial accident, which can lead to pollution and reduce the city's population.
<br>

<br>
Requires knowledge of the technology Plastics.
<br>

<h2>
Palace
</h2>

<p>
Construction of a Palace makes a city the capital and the center of your government. Waste in other cities (corruption, production waste, and food waste) is often related to how far away from the capital they are. On top of this, corruption and production waste in your capital is 30% of what it would otherwise be. A Courthouse with Post Office will eliminate it entirely.
<br>

<br>
The cost to enemy Diplomats and Spies of inciting a revolt in a city also depends upon the city's distance from the capital (under all forms of government). Your capital city itself cannot be incited to revolt and enjoys a bonus when enemy agents try to evade your own agents stationed in the city, or sabotage your buildings.
<br>

<br>
Take good care of your capital, as its loss may result in your empire plunging into civil war. Losing your current palace also results in losing whatever spaceship you might have. See Ecclesiastical Palace.
