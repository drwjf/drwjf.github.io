        Esacpe from Camp
    </h2>

    The player controls an unnamed prisoner of war who has been interned in a POW camp somewhere in northern Germany in
    1942. The camp itself is a small castle on a promontory surrounded on three sides by cliffs and the cold North Sea.
    The only entry to the camp is by a narrow road through the gatehouse and anyone passing through this must be
    carrying the correct papers. Everywhere else the camp is surrounded by fences or walls with guard dogs used to
    patrol the perimeter and guards in observation towers with searchlights posted to watch for any prisoners trying to
    escape. Beneath the camp there is also a maze of tunnels and drains, although these are dangerous to enter without
    some kind of light. The player's task is to escape from the camp. There are a number of different ways in which this
    can be achieved.

    The gaming environment is displayed in isometric 2.5D with the player's character initially in bed at the beginning
    of a day in the camp. The prisoner has a daily routine, along with all the other prisoners, which includes roll
    call, exercising, mealtimes and bedtime. The other prisoners will follow this routine and, if the player does not
    control the main character for a short period of time, their character will join in the routine. There are soldiers
    guarding the camp and they will apprehend the player if he is seen out of routine (prison guards only arrest on
    touch and only detect prisoners in their line of sight or indoors).

    The game logic and user interactive concept are inspired by the classic The Great Escape game for MS-DOS by Denton
    Designs. The game have used graphics, music, map, and text materials that come from the public domain licensed by
    Creative Commons License or Other Public Licenses.
