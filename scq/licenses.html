        <br><small><i>Atomix is a puzzle video game developed by Günter Krämer (as "Softtouch") and published by Thalion
            Software, released for the Commodore Amiga and other personal computers in late 1990. The object of the game
            is to assemble molecules from compound atoms by moving the atoms on a two-dimensional playfield. Once you
            push an atom in a certain direction, it will move until it hits something that makes it stop, which could be
            a wall or another atom. This behaviour is exactly what makes playing it not trivial and, therefore, fun, as
            you need to think quite a lot about how to have your molecule organized.</i></small>

          In this game, the player has to rotate mirrors to deflect a beam in order to destroy all the cells of each
          level. There are also other devices the player has to be careful not to touch with the beam for too much time
          because otherwise the system will overload.</i></small>

        Game</a> - a puzzle game with real quantum mechanics in a browser. It is a little bit hardly to play in iPhone,
      so I remade it to run as a native App in iOS platform.</li>
