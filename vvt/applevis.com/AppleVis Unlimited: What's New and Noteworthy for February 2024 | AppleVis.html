<h4>Bose Ultra Open Earbuds Review: A Compelling Offering for Those Who Prioritise Environmental Awareness, but at a Price</h4>

<p>By David Goodwin | February 24, 2024</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the release of the Ultra Open Earbuds featuring an unconventional open-ear design that attaches around the ears to let in environmental sounds, vital for situational awareness and spatial orientation for blind users like myself, Bose offers an intriguing alternative to other open-ear buds like <a href="https://www.applevis.com/reviews/sony-linkbuds-review-best-headphones-yet-full-ambient-awareness-without-compromising">Sony's LinkBuds,</a> bone conduction headphones such as <a href="https://shokz.com/products/openrunpro">Shokz' OpenRun Pro,</a> and in-ear buds with transparency modes like Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro.</a> At £299 (US$299), they won't be for everyone and might be a hard sell against those established and relatively more affordable options. However, early reviews left me wondering if Bose had managed to hit a sweet spot of ambient awareness, audio quality, and features, making me curious if they could tempt me away from the Shokz and AirPods I use daily.</p>
  
  <p>The Shokz OpenRun Pro are my companion on my daily 4+ mile walk around mostly quiet suburban streets. They leave my ears completely open to environmental sounds and are a secure and comfortable fit. The audio quality is good for my typical listening of either podcasts or audiobooks. Call quality is passable. They are a good choice for this use case, but feel rather basic and uninspiring when compared to the audio quality and features that you would expect from similarly priced earbuds.</p>
  
  <p>The Apple AirPods Pro are my choice when at home. The audio quality is very good for my use case and to my ears. They offer features that I miss when using the Shokz, such as Listen for Siri and Announce Notifications. However, even when fitted with foam tips, they always feel like they are on the point of falling out (the left one in particular). I'm always nervous when doing tasks like preparing food or washing dishes. They also start to feel uncomfortable after a couple hours of use, although taking them out briefly typically helps.</p>
  
  <p>I use both the Shokz and AirPods Pro daily, getting at least a couple hours from each. But both have limitations, so I wondered if the uniquely-designed Bose Ultra Open Earbuds could replace one or both given their ambient listening capabilities paired with the Bose signature audio quality.</p>

<h4>Add Widgets to Your Desktop in macOS Sonoma</h4>

<p>By Sebby | February 19, 2024</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the marquee features of macOS Sonoma is widgets on the desktop. The widgets can come from Mac apps, just as they could before in previous versions of macOS, where they appeared in Notification Centre. New to Sonoma, they can now also come from select iPhone apps running on your nearby iPhone.</p>
  
  <p>This is a pretty cool and useful feature, as it goes, for those wanting it, but when it was announced there didn't appear to be a way for a VoiceOver user to use it. At some point, Apple fixed it without telling anyone and, though it's still not documented anywhere as of time and writing, there's now special support in VoiceOver for dragging widgets onto your desktop. Personally, I've found it to be of limited utility, and I wouldn't miss it if it were gone, and of those I've tried, I'm mostly interested in using widgets from the Mac rather than iPhone. Still, I can imagine that it could fill gaps for easy access to information for people who appreciate it. Here's how to use it.</p>

<h4>How and When to Start Your Mac in Safe Mode</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this episode, Tyler demonstrates how to start your Mac in safe mode and explains in what situations this may be useful.</p>
  
  <p>Safe mode is a feature of macOS that disables login items, third-party drivers, and legacy system extensions at startup, useful if an incompatible item in one of these groups is causing a problem with your Mac. In addition, system caches are cleared, and a light check of your startup disk is performed when starting up in safe mode, which can identify possible issues that could be causing slower than expected performance.</p>
