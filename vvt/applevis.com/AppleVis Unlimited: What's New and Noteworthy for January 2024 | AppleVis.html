<h3>Recent News and Views</h3>

<h4>Apple Vision Accessibility: the 2023 AppleVis Report Card</h4>

<p>By AppleVis | January 15, 2024</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are thrilled to unveil our 2023 Apple Vision Accessibility Report Card, which provides valuable insights into the experiences and opinions of visually impaired community members who rely on VoiceOver, Braille support, or the low vision features on Apple devices.</p>
  
  <p>To gather the ratings and comments contained in the report card, we conducted a comprehensive survey where participants rated their experience using Apple's various platforms with the available vision accessibility features on a scale of 1 to 5. Additionally, we invited participants to provide detailed written feedback and suggestions for enhancing Apple's vision accessibility features and user experience. The survey also included questions that assessed Apple's performance in addressing vision-related bugs, as well as the new vision accessibility features added in 2023.</p>
  
  <p>We greatly appreciated everyone who took the time to complete the survey. Your participation was vital to producing a meaningful and accurate report card that reflects the real-world experiences of blind and low vision Apple users. Every completed survey response voiced valuable feedback and plays a part in advocating for continuous improvements in Apple's vision accessibility features.</p>
  
  <p>The report card below presents a summary of the survey results, showcasing the areas where Apple excels and where there is room for improvement. It also includes a selection of participant comments, providing further insight into the specific challenges and opportunities related to Apple's vision accessibility offerings.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> the 2023 Apple Vision Accessibility Report Card reveals slightly decreasing satisfaction with VoiceOver features and user experience across iOS, iPadOS and macOS compared to 2022, contrasted by mostly improved ratings for braille and low vision capabilities. While reactions to new 2023 vision accessibility features were moderately more positive with a 3.7 average rating compared to 3.5 in 2022, Apple's performance in addressing critical bugs remains low at 3.0. Overall the latest report card points to regressions in the VoiceOver experience but progress expanding support for braille and low vision users, tempered by persistent dissatisfaction regarding bug fixes.</p>
  
  <p>This report card enables our community to speak up and be heard directly by Apple. We hope that it will spark productive and inclusive conversations about the current state of accessibility on Apple devices for visually impaired users and influence the company's future roadmap.</p>

<h4>A Guide to Information Security and Privacy on macOS</h4>

<p>By Tyler | January 22, 2024</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you own a computer or mobile device, you probably know that while it can do some amazing things, the fact that it is used to store and handle some of your most personal and sensitive data makes securing it essential. In this guide, I will give an overview of some of the security, privacy, and anti-malware features included in macOS, in order to give you a clearer understanding of what you should and shouldn’t use in your situation. Keep in mind that this guide is not intended as a technical deep dive, nor is it intended to advise on a specific security threat that you may encounter. Rather, it is intended as a simple explainer of numerous features built into macOS that aim to keep your Mac, data, and online accounts reasonably private and secure.</p>
  
  <p>While the features and tips I describe in this guide are quite useful for protecting your Mac, data, and online accounts, it is important to note that none of these features are a replacement for good user judgement. In fact, it is often said that the weakest point in the security strategy for any computer, mobile device, or network is the user, as even when established best practices are followed, users may still fall victim to social engineering schemes that exploit their sense of fear, empathy, or compassion.</p>
  
  <p>For this reason, it is important to be aware of some of the most common tactics of such schemes, in order to identify them before they can compromise your Mac or online accounts. Therefore, later in this guide, I will provide a list of tips to help avoid such attempts.</p>
