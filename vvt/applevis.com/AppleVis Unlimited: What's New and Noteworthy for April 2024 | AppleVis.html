<h3>New and Noteworthy App Entries</h3>

<h4>Agent Of Adventure (iOS/iPadOS, Free With In-App Purchases)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>This game is an abandoned RPG game that develops the city using rewards earned by adventurers.</p>
  
  <p>Hire adventurers at the tavern and start your adventure once you have the equipment for the hired adventurers. In the adventure you will encounter various traps, caves and monsters. While left unattended, adventurers come back over those difficulties. Adventurers come home with "money", "experience value" and "items".</p>
  
  <p>Let's develop the town and guild with the money you got! You can build various shops in the city.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>If you build a weapon shop or armor shop, you will have plenty of equipment to bring to your adventure.</li>
  <li>If you build a tool shop and bring items that are useful for your adventure, your adventure will be stable.</li>
  <li>If you build a temple, you may be able to revive a dead adventurer.</li>
  <li>If you build a school, better adventurers will grow up.</li>
  <li>If you develop a tavern, many adventurers will gather.</li>
  <li>If you develop the guild, you will be able to raise the level of adventurers.</li>

  <p>Let the adventurers learn various skills using the “experience value” you have obtained! In this game, the adventurer does not grow and HP (life point) is not changed from 15 to 100, and the natural ability is hardly changed. Instead, learning various jobs makes you dying. -Fighters are good at fighting, and fighting with swords is good.</p>

<h4>Seeing AI (iOS/iPadOS, Free)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seeing AI is a free app that narrates the world around you. Designed with and for the blind and low vision community, this ongoing research project harnesses the power of AI to open up the visual world by describing nearby people, text and objects.</p>
  
  <p>Seeing AI provides tools to assist with a variety of daily tasks:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Short Text - Speaks text as soon as it appears in front of the camera.</li>
  <li>Documents - Provides audio guidance to capture a printed page, and recognizes the text, along with its original formatting.</li>
  <li>Products - Scans barcodes, using audio beeps to guide you; hear the name, and package information when available.</li>
  <li>People - Saves people’s faces so you can recognize them, and get an estimate of their age, gender, and expression.</li>
  <li>Currency - Recognizes currency notes.</li>
  <li>Scenes - Hear an overall description of the scene captured. Explore the photo by moving your finger over the screen to hear the location of different objects.</li>
  <li>World - An Audio Augmented Reality experience to explore an unfamiliar environment, including hearing objects announced around you with Spatial Audio (requires a device with a LiDAR, and iOS 14+).</li>
  <li>Indoor Navigation - Available on the World Channel, enables you to create routes through a building, like "entrance to classroom", and navigate by following the sound (requires a device with an A9 or later processor, and iOS 14+).</li>
  <li>Colors - Identifies colors.</li>
  <li>Handwriting - Reads handwritten text like in greeting cards (available in a subset of languages).</li>
  <li>Light - Generates an audible tone corresponding to the brightness in the surroundings.</li>
  <li>Images in other apps - Just tap “Share” and “Recognize with Seeing AI” to describe images from Mail, Photos, Twitter, and more.</li>
  <li>Browse Photos - Hear descriptions of photos saved on your device.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Current Version: 5.3 (April 5, 2024)</p>

<h5>Changes in Version 5.3</h5>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Find My Things - This new feature, available via the World channel on devices running iOS 14+, enables you to teach Seeing AI to recognize your personal objects. Most AI systems focus on large datasets of generic objects, so we built this system that provides an audio-first experience to teach new objects yourself. You can then follow the audio cues to locate your things.</li>
  <li>Ask questions about photos (English only) - You can now ask Seeing AI questions about photos on the Scene channel, in Browse Photos, or those shared from another app. For example, after hearing the rich description, you may wish to hear more about a specific aspect of the image.</li>
  <li>Rich image descriptions, when you tap "More Info", have been improved to include even more details. Additionally, the names of people you have taught Seeing AI to identify are now included. And, this is now available in all 19 languages in which Seeing AI is localized.</li>
  <li>Handwriting recognition is now also available in Japanese and Korean.</li>
  <li>Document orientation - After scanning a document, you can find out which way round it is - useful when organizing multiple pages for stapling, for example. Tap "More", then "Page Info".</li>
  <li>Plus, various bug fixes under the hood.</li>

<h3>Recent News and Views</h3>

<h4>A Guide to Securing Your Online Accounts with iCloud Keychain on iOS and iPadOS</h4>

<p>By Tyler | April 8, 2024</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re like most people, you likely have many online accounts with usernames and passwords. In this guide, I will describe how iCloud Keychain, the password manager built into iOS, iPadOS, and other Apple platforms, can help you create, use, and manage strong credentials for your online accounts.</p>
  
  <p>While iCloud Keychain is also available on macOS, as well as Chromium-based browsers on other operating systems, this guide will focus primarily on how to use it with iOS and iPadOS, in an effort to limit information overload. However, once you become familiar with iCloud Keychain on iOS and iPadOS, you’ll likely find that it works similarly on other platforms.</p>
  
  <p>With the proliferation and ubiquity of online accounts accessed with usernames and passwords, you may find the process of coming up with and remembering unique ones for each account fatiguing. In an effort to make passwords easier to create and remember, it may be tempting to base them on common words in the dictionary, musical artists, sports teams, birthdays, pets, and references to other things of significance in your life, and use the same or similar passwords for different accounts.</p>
  
  <p>However, while passwords created with such techniques may be easy to create and remember, they can be easily guessed by password cracking bots that are designed to quickly try numerous common or previously exposed passwords on websites until a desired account is accessed. Furthermore, using the same password across multiple accounts makes you additionally vulnerable, as if the password for one account is compromised, threat actors could then successfully try that password for another account of yours, further exposing your identity.</p>

<h4>The Humanware NLS eReader: a free braille device available only to patrons in the US</h4>

<p>By Scott Davert | April 10, 2024</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled (NLS), Library of Congress, has been known for distributing materials to <a href="https://www.loc.gov/nls/how-to-enroll/apply-for-nls-services">eligible patrons</a> for many years in specialized formats.   Not only is NLS known for their distribution of content, but it is also known for loaning equipment needed to consume the materials it makes available. While NLS has offered the downloading of both audio and braille content for years, they have not offered a way for patrons to consume the digital braille content until recently. Braille content in particular, though available, required the user to own a braille device to read the material. NLS is now distributing 2 different models of braille displays to its patrons who request them. The model the patron receives will depend on which device their state library loans out. One way to get more general information about the NLS eReader program is to read this <a href="https://aphconnectcenter.org/technology/feel-words-come-to-life-refreshable-braille-displays-and-the-nls-ereader-program">article from the APH Connect Center.</a></p>
  
  <p>The state where I live is one of those which distributes the NLS Humanware eReader. I recently signed up to receive one, particularly since the braille display I typically use had to be sent back after 3 years of use for cleaning and a new battery. While the feature set does not encompass what I have available on my device, it has a lot to offer and was free of charge. With some modifications to my workflow, I’m finding that the Humanware NLS eReader works quite well as a back-up. Though I’m aware of the NLS eReader being distributed by Zoomax in other states, the state I live in only provides the Humanware device.</p>
  
  <p>Upon arrival, the box contained the eReader, USB-A to USB-C cable, USB to AC charging brick with a braille NLS label on it, the User Guide in hard copy braille, lanyard, and a cable allowing the connection of NLS cartridges to the eReader to load content which had been received by postal mail. Having an embossed copy of the User Gide has been very helpful as a reference. This is particularly beneficial for those who prefer not to operate two pieces of technology simultaneously but are not yet familiar enough with the eReader to begin using it.</p>
  
  <p>The Humanware NLS eReader is a twenty-cell braille display featuring an ergonomic Perkins-style keyboard, 16 gigabytes of internal memory, and the ability to connect to external media through the USB-A port and SD card reader. This meant that when I needed to move data from my primary device to this one, I was able to put the SD card in the eReader and have all of my files available. It is also capable of connecting up to 5 Bluetooth devices and 1 USB device for use with a screen reader. The eReader also offers Wi-Fi support so that a patron can download braille content from the NLS, NFB Newsline and Bookshare. The device also has the ability to keep track of the time and date. It measures 7.2 inches long by 3.3 inches wide by 0.8 inches thick and weighs 0.88 pounds. It is important to note that this is a “reader” and not a device intended for taking notes and performing other writing functions. Also worth noting, though, is that the NLS eReader can connect to screen readers such as VoiceOver, JAWS and NVDA, permitting the user to write with the Perkins-style keyboard.</p>
  
  <p>Those familiar with the Brailliant BI20X or Chameleon 20 are already acquainted with the physical appearance of the Humanware NLS eReader. Positioning the device so the spacebars are closest to you, the lay-out is as follows:  On the front edge from left to right are five buttons. First is the Up Thumb Key followed by the Left Thumb Key, which is about twice as long as the Up Thumb Key. In the middle is a circular shaped button known as the Select Key. To the right of the Select Key is the Right Thumb Key, followed by the Down Thumb Key. The Right Thumb Key is larger than the Down Thumb Key. The two larger thumb keys on the front of the device are what pan the display back and forth. The Up and Down Thumb Keys are used for navigational purposes that depend on the application in use and how they are configured. An easy way to remember which key performs which function is that each of the rectangular buttons has a line on that part of the button. For example, there is a raised line on the full top edge of the Up Arrow and one along the right edge for the Right Arrow.</p>
  
  <p>On the left side you will find 4 items. Moving from front to back, you will encounter holes for a lanyard strap to be attached. Behind this, the user will find a USB-A port used for inserting a thumb drive. Continuing to explore the left side, the item behind the USB-A port is the Power button. Pressing and holding it for several seconds will toggle the power, and a quick press when the device is on will either wake it up or put it to sleep. Behind the Power button is a USBC port for charging or connecting the eReader to a computer.</p>
  
  <p>Another hole is located on the right side of the device and is the closest thing to the user on that side. Behind this, the user will find 2 volume buttons and a 3.5MM headphone jack which is covered. These volume buttons and 3.5 MM headphone jack are things that are used on the Brailliant and Chameleon but are not utilized with the eReader program.</p>
  
  <p>On the top surface, the keys located closest to you are two spacebars. Behind these, you will find the twenty braille cells with a corresponding Cursor Routing Key behind each cell. Behind the Cursor Routing Keys, is a standard eight-dot Perkins-style braille keyboard. Along the back side of the display, you will find an SD card reader. The under-side of the Humanware NLS eReader has a braille serial number and 4 rubber feet to hold it in place. It’s important to note that though the Humanware eReader is in the body of a Brailliant, the software is not the same, nor are some of the keyboard shortcuts. For example, space with m on the Chameleon and Brailliant is used to go to the relevant context menu. On the Humanware NLS eReader, the user would press space with h to launch this menu and would press space with M to go back to the eReader’s main menu.</p>
