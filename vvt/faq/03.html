    <h1>What is the soundscape app for visually impaired people?</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Unlike step-by-step navigation apps, Soundscape used 3D audio cues to enrich ambient awareness and provided a new way to relate to the environment. It provided comfort in unfamiliar spaces, supporting individuals in making mental maps and personal route choices. VoiceVista is licensed under the MIT License to continue providing the service to blind and vision impaired community.</b>
    </p>
        
    <p>
        The VoiceVista app leverages advanced iOS audio technology and precise location services to empower individuals in
        developing a heightened sense of their environment. It offers reassurance in unfamiliar settings, assisting users in
        forming mental maps and confidently navigating their desired routes.
    </p>

    <p>
        VoiceVista provided information about your surroundings with synthesized binaural audio, creating the effect of 3D
        sound. It ran in the background in conjunction with navigation or other applications to provide you with additional
        context about the environment. Your phone, in hand or in pocket, tracked movement using location and activity
        sensors, and let you move toward a self-set audio beacon. Soundscape ran on iPhone SE, iPhone 6S or later and was
        compatible with most wired or Bluetooth stereo headsets.
