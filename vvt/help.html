    <hr>

    <h2>Configuring VoiceVista</h2>

    <h3>Voices</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista can use any of the voices you have downloaded in the iOS Settings app except for the Siri voices which
        are not available to VoiceVista. We recommend choosing one of the "Enhanced" voices as they have a much higher
        voice quality, but in order to do so, you will first need to download an enhanced voice. You can download voices
        in the iOS Settings app by going to Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices and tapping on a voice. Within the
        VoiceVista app, you can select the voice you want to use by going to Settings from the main menu and then
        selecting "Voice".</p>

    <h3>Using Apple AirPods</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista supports spatial audio with dynamic head tracking when using compatible AirPods. When connected to
        VoiceVista, sensors in the AirPods tell VoiceVista the direction your head is facing. This helps VoiceVista to
        improve your audio experience making it more natural as you move around in the world. When you use VoiceVista
        with AirPods connected, you do not need to hold your phone for VoiceVista to work correctly.</p>
    <p>You can use AirPods with VoiceVista anytime you would normally use VoiceVista. Using AirPods provides you with
        high quality audio and allows you to have a more hands-free experience with VoiceVista.</p>
    <p><b>Connecting a Device</b>:<br /> Go to the "Head Tracking Headphones" item in the VoiceVista menu to connect
        your AirPods and follow the instructions on screen. Note that you will need to pair your AirPods to your phone
        in the Bluetooth settings before connecting them in VoiceVista.</p>
    <p><b>Using the Media Controls on your Headphones</b>:<br /> When media controls are enabled in the VoiceVista
        settings, you can use the media controls on your AirPods to mute or unmute the beacon, call out your location or
        to repeat the last callout. For more information, see the "Using Media Controls" help section</p>

    <h3>Using Media Controls</h3>
    <p>You can access certain features in VoiceVista with the help of the media control buttons on your headphones. This
        functionality works with any wired or Bluetooth headphones that have media control buttons like Play, Pause,
        Next, Previous and others. Different headphones may include different buttons so please refer to the list of
        actions below to determine which ones are available to you.<br>Also note that this feature only works with
        headphones that support Apple's media controls (such as play and pause).</p>
    <p>Headphone media controls can be used while VoiceVista is running. This is true whether you are currently in
        VoiceVista or while VoiceVista is in the background and even while your device is locked. Note however that
        headphone media control buttons will not work with VoiceVista if you are playing audio like music, podcasts or
        videos with another app.</p>
    <p>
    <p>You can access the following features in VoiceVista using your the media control buttons on your headphones:
    <p><br>&#x23EF Play/Pause: Mute any current callouts and if the audio beacon is set, toggle the beacon audio. </p>
    <p>&#x23ED Next: Callout <em>"My Location"</em>.</p>
    <p>&#x23EE Previous: Repeat last callout.</p>
    <p>&#x23E9 Skip Forward: Toggle callouts On and Off.</p>
    <p>&#x23EA Skip Backward: Callout <em>"Around Me"</em>.</p>
    </p>

    <h2>Beacons and Callouts</h2>
    <h3>Audio Beacon</h3>
    <p>Setting a beacon on a nearby location allows VoiceVista to keep you informed by playing an audible beacon sound
        coming from the direction of that location. This beacon can be muted or unmuted on the home screen.
        Additionally, VoiceVista displays information about the location on the home screen including the distance to it
        and its street address if it is known.</p>
    <p>Setting a beacon is useful when you want to keep track of a familiar landmark as you explore a new area or when
        you are going somewhere and want to be informed about your surroundings along the way. The beacon feature does
        not give you turn-by-turn directions, but it does give you a continuous audible sound that tells you the
        direction to the beacon, relative to where you are currently located. Using the audio beacon, your existing
        wayfinding skills, and even your favourite navigation app, you can choose how you want to get to nearby
        locations yourself.</p>
    <p><b>To set a beacon</b>:<br /> First, view the details for a location by either using the search bar to search for
        a place, or tapping one of the "Places Nearby", "Saved Markers", or "Current Location" buttons and selecting a
        location. From the location details screen you can select the "Start Audio Beacon" button. Tapping this will
        return you to the home screen and turn on an audible beacon coming from the direction of the place you selected.
        The name of the place you have selected along with its distance and physical address, if available, will now be
        displayed on the main app screen.</p>
    <p><b>To remove the current beacon</b>:<br /> Simply press the "Remove Beacon" button on the home screen.</p>
    <p><b>To mute the audible beacon</b>:<br /> Tap the "Mute Beacon" button underneath the "Remove Beacon" button on
        the home screen.</p>

    <h3>Automatic Callouts</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista can tell you about things around you as you approach them by calling out their name from the direction
        they are located in. The app will do this automatically for all sorts of things like businesses, bus stops, and
        even intersections. You can configure what the app automatically calls out in the "Manage Callouts" section of
        the "Settings" screen, and you can turn all callouts off when you want the app to be silent.</p>
    <p><b>Exploring a new area</b>:<br /> Turn automatic callouts on and walk around to hear about all of the different
        stores, restaurants, and the like as you pass them.</p>
    <p><b>Walking to a specific location</b>:<br /> When you are on your way to a particular location, automatic
        callouts for intersections can be particularly useful. Intersection callouts tell you about the layout of
        intersections as you approach them, and confirm the road you are on when you leave them.</p>
    <p><b>When you need silence</b>:<br /> When you are about to cross a road or just need the app to be quiet, you can
        turn callouts off. When callouts are off, the app will only tell you information if you manually tap one of the
        <em>"My Location"</em>, <em>"Nearby Markers"</em>, <em>"Around Me"</em>, or <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> buttons.</p>
    <p><b>Turning callouts on or off</b>:<br /> Turning callouts off will silence the app. Callouts can be turned on or
        off in the "Manage Callouts" section of the "Settings" screen where you can tap the "Allow Callouts" toggle to
        turn callouts on or off. You can also turn callouts on or off by using the "skip forward" command (double tap
        and hold) if your headphones have media control buttons. Alternatively, you can use the "Sleep" button in the
        upper right hand corner of the home screen to stop VoiceVista from making callouts until you choose to wake it
        up again.</p>
    <p><b>Managing which callouts you hear</b>:<br /> To choose the types of things VoiceVista will automatically
        callout, go to the "Settings" screen using the menu on the "Home" screen. The "Manage Callouts" section of the
        "Settings" screen contains a list of types of things the app can callout. Each item has a toggle button that you
        can turn on or off. If you wish to turn off all callouts, tap the "Allow Callouts" toggle at the top of the
        list.</p>


    <h2>Hear My Surroundings</h2>

    <h3>My Location</h3>
    <p>The <em>"My Location"</em> button quickly gives you information that helps you figure out where you currently
        are. <em>"My Location"</em> tells you about your current location including things like the direction you are
        facing, where nearby roads or intersections are, and where nearby points of interest are.</p>
    <p><em>"My Location"</em> is useful when you need to figure out where you are or what cardinal direction you are
        facing.</p>
    <p>As with all four of the buttons at the bottom of the home screen, hold your phone with the screen flat (facing
        towards the sky) and the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing before you press the <em>"My
            Location"</em> button. This acts like a compass telling the app which direction you are facing. Simply, tap
        the <em>"My Location"</em> button and listen.</p>

    <h3>Around Me</h3>
    <p>The <em>"Around Me"</em> button tells you about one thing in each of the four quadrants around you (ahead, to the
        right, behind, and to the left). <em>"Around Me"</em> is intended to help you orient yourself to your
        surroundings.</p>
    <p>When you are trying to get your bearings and orient yourself to your surroundings, use <em>"Around Me"</em> to
        hear about the things around you.</p>
    <p>As with all four of the buttons at the bottom of the home screen, hold your phone with the screen flat (facing
        towards the sky) and the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing before you press the
        <em>"Around Me"</em> button. This acts like a compass telling the app which direction you are facing. Simply,
        tap the <em>"Around Me"</em> button and you will hear four points of interest arranged around you.</p>

    <h3>Ahead of Me</h3>
    <p>The <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> button tells you about four things ahead of you. <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> is intended to
        help you explore the way ahead of yourself when you are learning about a new area.</p>
    <p>When you are walking down the street, try using <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> to discover the places and things coming
        up on either side of the street ahead.</p>
    <p>As with all four of the buttons at the bottom of the home screen, hold your phone with the screen flat (facing
        towards the sky) and the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing before you press the
        <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> button. This acts like a compass telling the app which direction you are facing. Simply,
        tap the <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> button and you will hear several points of interest all roughly ahead of you.</p>

    <h3>Nearby Markers</h3>
    <p>The <em>"Nearby Markers"</em> button tells you about up to four markers that are closest to you. <em>"Nearby
            Markers"</em> is intended to help you orient yourself using places you already know about.</p>
    <p>When you are trying to get your bearings and orient yourself to your surroundings, use <em>"Nearby Markers"</em>
        to hear about the locations of places you know of.</p>
    <p>As with all four of the buttons at the bottom of the home screen, hold your phone with the screen flat (facing
        towards the sky) and the top of the phone pointing in the direction you are facing before you press the
        <em>"Nearby Markers"</em> button. This acts like a compass telling the app which direction you are facing.
        Simply, tap the <em>"Nearby Markers"</em> button and you will hear up to four markers near you.</p>

    <h2>Markers and Routes</h2>

    <h3>Markers</h3>
    <p>With VoiceVista, you can mark your world and anything you care about.</p>
    <p>You can mark things that are personal and relevant to you like your home, your office and your preferred grocery
        store. You can mark any place or address, but you can also mark things that might traditionally not be available
        in maps, for example, entrances to buildings or parks, push-to-walk buttons, pedestrian crossings or bridges,
        bus stops or even your dog’s favourite tree and use these as references along your walk.</p>
    <p>To experience marked places, VoiceVista will automatically call out marked places as you walk by or approach
        them, or you can also use the Nearby markers button at the bottom of the VoiceVista home screen to hear a
        spatial callout of marked places around you. In addition, you have the ability to set an audio beacon on any
        marked place. When you do this, the VoiceVista audio beacon you are familiar with, will be heard and you can
        operate it as usual.</p>

    <h3>Routes</h3>
    <p>Routes are a series of waypoints. You will be informed on arrival to each waypoint, and the Audio Beacon will
        automatically advance to the next waypoint.</p>
    <p>You may want to create and use a route somewhere you know to make sure you keep on track, or you may want to use
        it as a tool to help familiarise yourself along a new journey.</p>
    <p><b>Creating a route</b>:<br /> First, go to "Markers & Routes", select the "Routes" tab, and then select the "New
        Route" button. Give the route a name and an optional description, then add waypoints as you go or pick them from
        your list of Markers. You can rearrange the order of the waypoints along a route at any time by editing the
        route.</p>
    <p><b>Editing a route</b>:<br /> Select your route on the "Markers & Routes" page and then select "Edit Route". From
        here you can add and remove waypoints, as well as editing the name and description of the route.</p>
    <p><b>Sharing a route</b>:<br /> Select your route on the "Markers & Routes" page and then select the option to
        "Share" using all of the usual share options available to you.</p>

    <h3>Creeating Markers</h3>
    <p>You can create markers in three ways: searching for the place you would like to save using the search bar,
        finding somewhere using the "Places Nearby" button, or using the "Use Current Location" button, all of which can
        be found on the VoiceVista home screen. Once you have found the place you would like, selecting it will take you
        to the "Location Details" page. On this page, select the button called "Save Marker".</p>
    <p>You will now have the option to customise this marker. This step is optional. If you want to, you can change the
        name of the marker and also add an annotation that will be called out along with the marker to provide some
        extra information. Once you are done, select the "Done" button to save your Marker. </p>

    <h3>Customising Markers</h3>
    <p>If you want to rename a marker you previously created, or add an annotation to it, then you can do so by
        selecting the marker from the "Markers" tab of the "Markers & Routes" page, then selecting the "Edit Marker"
        button. You can use this to give markers descriptive or useful nicknames, as well as giving them a longer
        description using the annotation field.</p>
    <p>From this Edit screen, you can also delete a marker if you no longer need it.</p>
