<body style="font: -apple-system-body; margin: 20px;">
    <h2 id="a-1">What is VoiceVista?</h2>
    <div>Microsoft discontinued the project <a href="https://aka.ms/ossblog">Soundscape</a> and made it <a
            href="https://github.com/microsoft/soundscape">open-source</a>. VoiceVista is licensed under <a
            href="https://github.com/microsoft/soundscape/blob/main/LICENSE.txt">the MIT
            License</a> to continue providing the service to blind and vision impaired community.</div>
    <div>VoiceVista helps you stay aware of where you are and where you're going by using unique audio guidance and by
        calling out roads, intersections, and places as you approach them.</div>
    <div>VoiceVista uses 3D sound to let you know what’s around you. For example, if your destination is on your right,
        you will hear sound coming from that direction, or if a coffee shop is on your left, you will hear a callout
        from that direction.</div>
    <div>Place an audio beacon on your destination and VoiceVista will keep you informed of its location and your
        surroundings along the way. Use VoiceVista in conjunction with your wayfinding skills and even your favorite
        navigation app to find your way to your destination.</div>
    <div>Put away the phone and walk. VoiceVista will help you stay aware of where you are by calling out roads,
        intersections, and landmarks as you approach them. Callouts can be adjusted in the settings.</div>
    <div>Hold the phone flat in your hand, and use the buttons to locate roads and upcoming intersections, orient to
        familiar landmarks around you, and explore landmarks ahead of you.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-1">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-2">When should I use VoiceVista?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista has features and benefits that span a variety of scenarios and time scales. Furthermore, VoiceVista’s
        value to you may evolve over time so how you use it today may differ from how you will use it in three months.
        People often think about apps in terms of "what problem is this app good at solving?" VoiceVista certainly can
        be used on a case by case basis when you have a specific information need – such as keeping track of a
        destination as you make your way there, helping to orient yourself when you emerge from a metro station, getting
        your bearings when exiting a car, or finding the street names for, or distance to, the next intersection.
        However, the philosophy behind VoiceVista is one of "lighting up your world with sound", designed to be used
        anytime you are out and about to provide ambient awareness of your surroundings, such as keeping you aware of
        the names of the streets you are on, the direction you are heading, and the names of businesses you are passing.
    </div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-2">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-2-1">What will be reported when I press buttons in Surroundings?</h2>
    <div>The <em>"My Location"</em> button quickly gives you information that helps you figure out where you currently
        are. <em>"My Location"</em> tells you about your current location including things like the direction you are
        facing, where nearby roads or intersections are, and where nearby points of interest are.</div>
    <div><em>"My Location"</em> is useful when you need to figure out where you are or what cardinal direction you are
        facing.</div>
    <div>The <em>"Around Me"</em> button tells you about one thing in each of the four quadrants around you (ahead, to the
        right, behind, and to the left). <em>"Around Me"</em> is intended to help you orient yourself to your
        surroundings.</div>
    <div>When you are trying to get your bearings and orient yourself to your surroundings, use <em>"Around Me"</em> to
        hear about the things around you.</div>
    <div>The <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> button tells you about four things ahead of you. <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> is intended to
        help you explore the way ahead of yourself when you are learning about a new area.</div>
    <div>When you are walking down the street, try using <em>"Ahead of Me"</em> to discover the places and things coming
        up on either side of the street ahead.</div>
    <div>The <em>"Nearby Markers"</em> button tells you about up to four markers that are closest to you. <em>"Nearby
            Markers"</em> is intended to help you orient yourself using places you already know about.</div>
    <div>When you are trying to get your bearings and orient yourself to your surroundings, use <em>"Nearby Markers"</em>
        to hear about the locations of places you know of.</div>
    <div>As with all four of the buttons, hold your phone with the screen flat (facing towards the sky) and the top of the
        phone pointing in the direction you are facing before you press the button. This acts like a compass telling the app
        which direction you are facing.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-2-1">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-3">What are Markers and how do I get the most out of them?</h2>
    <div>Markers are places that you have saved. They could be places that are discoverable within the app, or they could
        be entirely new places you have added yourself. You can save your current location as a marker by selecting the
        "Markers" tab and then tapping top right bar button. You can save other locations as a marker by selecting
        "Places Nearby" item in "Surroundings" tab, and then searching for the place you would like to save using the search
        bar, or finding somewhere from the nearby places. Once you have found the place you would like, selecting it will
        take you to the "Location Details" page. On this page, tap the top right bar button.</div>
    <div>You can mark any place or address, but you can also mark things that might traditionally not be available
        in maps, for example, entrances to buildings or parks, push-to-walk buttons, pedestrian crossings or bridges,
        bus stops or even your dog’s favourite tree and use these as references along your walk.</div>
    <div>To experience marked places, VoiceVista will automatically call out marked places as you walk by or approach
        them, or you can also use the Nearby markers button at the bottom of the VoiceVista home screen to hear a
        spatial callout of marked places around you. In addition, you have the ability to set an audio beacon on any
        marked place. When you do this, the VoiceVista audio beacon you are familiar with, will be heard and you can
        operate it as usual.</div>
    <div>You have the option to customise saved markers. If you want to, you can change the name of the marker and also add an
        annotation that will be called out along with the marker to provide some extra information.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-3">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-3-1">What are Routes?</h2>
    <div>Routes are a series of waypoints. You will be informed on arrival to each waypoint, and the Audio Beacon will
        automatically advance to the next waypoint.</div>
    <div>You may want to create and use a route somewhere you know to make sure you keep on track, or you may want to use
        it as a tool to help familiarise yourself along a new journey.</div>
    <div><b>Creating a route</b>:<br /> First, go to "Routes" tab, and then select the "Add" button in the top-right
        corner. Give the route a name and an optional description, then add waypoints as you go or pick them from
        your list of Markers. You can rearrange the order of the waypoints along a route at any time by editing the
        route.</div>
    <div><b>Editing a route</b>:<br /> Select your route on the "Routes" tab and then select "Edit Route Name" or "Edit
        Waypoints" in the top right corner. From here you can add and remove waypoints, as well as editing the name and
        description of the route.</div>
    <div><b>Sharing a route</b>:<br /> Select your route on the "Routes" tab and then select the option to "Share" using all
        of the usual share options available to you.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-3-1">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-4">What can I set as a beacon?</h2>
    <div>You can set an audio beacon on any business, place, point of interest, address, or intersection. There are a few
        ways you can add a location as a marker. First, view the details for a location by either using the search bar
        to search for a place, or tapping one of the "Places Nearby", or "Markers", and selecting a location. From the
        location details screen you can select the "Start Beacon" button. Tapping this will return you to the home screen
        and turn on an audible beacon coming from the direction of the place you selected. The name of the place you have
        selected along with its distance and physical address, if available, will now be displayed on the main app screen.
    </div>
    <div>Setting a beacon on a nearby location allows VoiceVista to keep you informed by playing an audible beacon sound
        coming from the direction of that location. This beacon can be muted or unmuted on the home screen.
        Additionally, VoiceVista displays information about the location on the home screen including the distance to it
        and its street address if it is known.</div>
    <div>Setting a beacon is useful when you want to keep track of a familiar landmark as you explore a new area or when
        you are going somewhere and want to be informed about your surroundings along the way. The beacon feature does
        not give you turn-by-turn directions, but it does give you a continuous audible sound that tells you the
        direction to the beacon, relative to where you are currently located. Using the audio beacon, your existing
        wayfinding skills, and even your favourite navigation app, you can choose how you want to get to nearby
        locations yourself.</div>
    <div><b>To set a beacon</b>:<br /> First, view the details for a location by either using the search bar to search for
        a place, or tapping one of the "Places Nearby", "Saved Markers", or "Current Location" buttons and selecting a
        location. From the location details screen you can select the "Start Audio Beacon" button. Tapping this will
        return you to the home screen and turn on an audible beacon coming from the direction of the place you selected.
        The name of the place you have selected along with its distance and physical address, if available, will now be
        displayed on the main app screen.</div>
    <div><b>To remove the current beacon</b>:<br /> Simply press the "Remove Beacon" button on the home screen.</div>
    <div><b>To mute the audible beacon</b>:<br /> Tap the "Mute Beacon" button underneath the "Remove Beacon" button on
        the home screen.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-4">TOC</a></div>
    
    <h2 id="a-5">How do I use a beacon like a pro?</h2>
    <div>You can think of the audible beacon as a "lighthouse for the ears", notifying you of where your destination is
        relative to your location, as the crow flies. Like a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may
        need to make many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many strategic
        "tacks" to get closer to the lighthouse. The continuous rhythmic sound of the audible beacon is spatialised
        from the direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of the location of the destination relative to
        you as you walk. When you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone toward the
        destination, a higher pitched "ring" sound will be heard. This feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of
        the destination since the direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud
        environments. When searching for the higher pitched "ring", hold the phone flat and sweep the phone slowly;
        turning your head to point in the same direction of the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio
        experience.</div>
    <div>The lighthouse metaphor for the beacon’s design has several natural implications:</div>
    <div>1. There is no "correct" direction to travel when using the beacon, instead, with VoiceVista you choose how to
        get there;</div>
    <div>2. The higher pitched "ring" helps you pinpoint the direction of the destination only – it is not an
        indication of how you should get there;</div>
    <div>3. If you generally know how to get to your destination, you may wish to mute the beacon for the majority of your
        trip and turn it on only as you get closer to your destination.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-5">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-6">Why does the audible beacon disappear sometimes?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista’s audible beacon is fundamentally a directional cue, telling you where your destination is relative to
        the direction you are facing. When VoiceVista is uncertain about what direction you are facing, it lowers the
        volume of the beacon. Most often this occurs if you have been walking with the phone stored in a pocket or bag,
        and you stop moving, such as to cross a street. The beacon will get louder once you start moving again, or if
        you hold the phone flat and point it in the direction you are facing.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-6">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-7">Can I set a beacon on an address?</h2>
    <div>Yes you can. After you found the address using the search field, You can add it as a marker by selecting the "Save"
        button, or using "Start beacon" to set it as a beacon immediately</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-7">TOC</a></div>

    <h2  id="a-8">How do I set a beacon on my home?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista supports setting beacons on addresses. To set a beacon on your home, or any other address, search for
        a location from the main VoiceVista screen. On the "Location Details" screen, tap the "Start Beacon" button.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-8">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-9">When I set a beacon on a destination, how close will VoiceVista get me to the destination?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista can determine the location of your destination to within several metres, but not less. When VoiceVista
        determines that you are close to your destination, you will hear a final callout that your destination is
        nearby, and the beacon will turn off.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-9">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-10">Can I turn the beacon back on when I am close to my destination?</h2>
    <div>Yes, you can turn the beacon back on once VoiceVista turns it off by selecting the "unmute beacon button";
        however, since Location Services is only accurate to about 10 metres, we cannot guarantee the behaviour of the
        beacon when you are within a few metres of your destination.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-10">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-11">Why does VoiceVista call out road names twice when I approach an intersection?</h2>
    <div>To accommodate a variety of intersection configurations, VoiceVista describes intersections as segments of
        roadways that depart from a common point. VoiceVista uses spatial audio to indicate the name of the road that
        goes to the left, the name of the road that continues straight ahead, and the name of the road that goes to the
        right, in that order. If the description of the intersection begins with the road you are on rather than one to
        the left, then the intersection is a T with the road you are on continuing ahead and a road intersecting from
        the right. Similarly, if the description only includes a road to the left and to the right, you will know that
        the road you are on ends at a T ahead of you. This method of describing intersections also supports the case
        when a road changes name at an intersection.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-11">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-12">Why doesn’t VoiceVista announce every business that I pass?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista is designed not to be too chatty. In addition, it uses Open Street Map as its back-end data source.
        Open Street Map (OSM, https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a community-developed and edited map of the world,
        relying on individuals, to enter and curate the data. If a business or point of interest is not announced by
        VoiceVista, the most probable reason is that the business has not been added, or in some cases updated, by a
        member of the OSM community yet.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-12">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-13">Why do some callouts stop when I'm in a vehicle?</h2>
    <div>In order to stop the number of callouts becoming overwhelming, some categories, such as intersections, are not
        announced automatically when you’re travelling in a vehicle.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-13">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-14">What if I don't understand a callout or miss it because of ambient noise?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista has a list of your recent callouts so that you can revisit callouts that you might have missed. To
        find this, tap on the search button on the Nearby Filters screen. At the bottom of this page, there is a section
        for "Recent Callouts" where the callout you missed will be listed.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-14">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-15">What phone does VoiceVista run on?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista is currently available for Apple iOS, running on iPhone SE, iPhone 6S and later.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-15">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-16">What headphones should I use with VoiceVista?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista supports spatial audio with dynamic head tracking when using compatible AirPods. When connected to
        VoiceVista, sensors in the AirPods tell VoiceVista the direction your head is facing. This helps VoiceVista to
        improve your audio experience making it more natural as you move around in the world. When you use VoiceVista
        with AirPods connected, you do not need to hold your phone for VoiceVista to work correctly.</div>
    <div>You can use AirPods with VoiceVista anytime you would normally use VoiceVista. Using AirPods provides you with
        high quality audio and allows you to have a more hands-free experience with VoiceVista.</div>
    <div><b>Connecting a Device</b>:<br /> Go to the "Head Tracking Headphones" item in the VoiceVista menu to connect
        your AirPods and follow the instructions on screen. Note that you will need to pair your AirPods to your phone
        in the Bluetooth settings before connecting them in VoiceVista.</div>
    <div><b>Using the Media Controls on your Headphones</b>:<br /> When media controls are enabled in the VoiceVista
        settings, you can use the media controls on your AirPods to mute or unmute the beacon, call out your location or
        to repeat the last callout.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-16">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-16-1">How to use media controls?</h2>
    <div>You can access certain features in VoiceVista with the help of the media control buttons on your headphones. This
        functionality works with any wired or Bluetooth headphones that have media control buttons like Play, Pause,
        Next, Previous and others. Different headphones may include different buttons so please refer to the list of
        actions below to determine which ones are available to you.<br>Also note that this feature only works with
        headphones that support Apple's media controls (such as play and pause).</div>
    <div>Headphone media controls can be used while VoiceVista is running. This is true whether you are currently in
        VoiceVista or while VoiceVista is in the background and even while your device is locked. Note however that
        headphone media control buttons will not work with VoiceVista if you are playing audio like music, podcasts or
        videos with another app.</div>
    <div>You can access the following features in VoiceVista using your the media control buttons on your headphones:
    <div><br>&#x23EF Play/Pause: Mute any current callouts and if the audio beacon is set, toggle the beacon audio. </div>
    <div>&#x23ED Next: Callout <em>"My Location"</em>.</div>
    <div>&#x23EE Previous: Repeat last callout.</div>
    <div>&#x23E9 Skip Forward: Toggle callouts On and Off.</div>
    <div>&#x23EA Skip Backward: Callout <em>"Around Me"</em>.</div>

    <h2 id="a-17">How does VoiceVista impact my iPhone’s battery?</h2>
    <div>Battery life varies significantly depending on which iPhone you own and how old it is. The biggest drain on your
        battery is having the screen on, so to maximise the battery life of your phone you should keep the screen locked
        whenever possible. To help minimise the impact on your iPhone battery VoiceVista now has a Sleep Mode and a
        Snooze Mode. To further reduce the amount of battery you use, when you aren’t using VoiceVista, you should force
        close it via your iPhone’s App Switcher. </div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-17">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-18">How do I use Sleep Mode to minimise VoiceVista’s impact on my phone battery?</h2>
    <div>To put VoiceVista in to Sleep Mode select the "Sleep" button in the top right hand corner of the screen. When
        you select this VoiceVista will stop using Location Services and mobile data until you choose to wake it up
        again.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-18">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-19">How do I use Snooze mode to minimise VoiceVista’s impact on my phone battery?</h2>
    <div>To put VoiceVista in to Snooze Mode select the "Sleep" button in the top right hand corner of the screen. Once
        VoiceVista’s in Sleep mode, select the "Wake up when I leave" button and VoiceVista will go in to a low power
        state until you leave your current location.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-19">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-20">How does my choice of headphones affect the battery life of my phone?</h2>
    <div>In history tests, the battery consumption of Bluetooth headphones is comparable to wired headphones and should
        not be a significant factor to consider when selecting headphones. That said, both earbud and bone-conducting
        headphones have wired and wireless model options.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-20">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-21">How does running VoiceVista in the background impact battery life of my phone?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista is a location-based app and uses Location Services to determine your location. In our tests,
        VoiceVista does not consume any more battery than the average map application; but if you are concerned about
        battery consumption when using your phone, the following are a few tips which will help lower usage:</div>
    <div>1. Turn the screen display off as much as possible when you are not interacting with the app.</div>
    <div>2. When not using the app, close it down. VoiceVista uses location services continually when it is running so
        that it always knows your location, even when you are not moving. Don’t forget to restart the app when you resume
        your journey.</div>
    <div>3. In cold weather, keep your phone warm as batteries perform more poorly in colder temperatures.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-21">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-22">How much mobile data does VoiceVista use?</h2>
    <div>The amount of mobile data used depends on how you use VoiceVista. We have designed VoiceVista to use only a small
        amount of data when you’re out and about by doing things like saving points as you walk around so you don’t need
        to download them again every time you go back to somewhere you’ve already been. To reduce the amount of mobile
        data you use, make sure you are connected to Wi-Fi whenever possible, particularly to download the app. When you
        are not using VoiceVista, you should use the "Sleep" button to put VoiceVista to sleep or force close the app.
    </div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-22">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-23">How is VoiceVista different from other map apps?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista provides an ambient description of your surroundings in aid of exploration and way-finding. Using
        spatial audio, VoiceVista will call out points of interest, parks, roads, and intersections from the direction
        they physically are in your immediate environment as you walk. For example, if you pass a shop on your right,
        you will hear the name of the shop sounding from your right. As you approach an intersection, you will hear each
        road name sounding from the direction it goes in, beginning to your left, ahead and to the right.</div>
    <div>VoiceVista play an audible beacon in the direction of your destination, empowering you to make your way there on your
        terms using your increased awareness of your surroundings and the location of your destination. And VoiceVista
        provides turn by turn directions to the next destination for your convenient.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-23">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-24">How do I use VoiceVista with a wayfinding app?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista is designed as an awareness app to help fill in details about your environment that you may not be
        aware of otherwise. While it provides turn-by-turn direction to the next beacon, it can be used alongside other
        navigation apps to provide complementary information. To use VoiceVista with these apps, start your navigation app
        first. Then, move over to VoiceVista and set a beacon on the same destination as in the navigation app. At this
        point, both apps will be running and you will hear walking directions from your navigation app, while getting
        updates on points of interest, intersections, and your distance to your destination from VoiceVista.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-24">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-25">How do I control what I hear and when I hear it in VoiceVista?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista provides several ways to control what you hear and when:</div>
    <div>1. Immediately stop all audio: Double tap the screen with two fingers to immediately turn off all audio,
        including any callout that is currently playing and the beacon if it is on. Callouts will resume automatically when
        you approach the next intersection or point of interest, but the audible beacon will not. Select the "unmute beacon
        button" on the main screen to resume hearing the beacon.</div>
    <div>2. Stop automatic callouts: When you are not travelling or have reached a destination, you probably will not need
        VoiceVista to continue to notify you of things around you. Instead of exiting the app, you can put VoiceVista in to
        Snooze mode and it will wake up again when you leave, or you can put VoiceVista into Sleep mode and it will stay off
        until you choose to turn it back on. Alternatively, you can select "Settings" from the tabs and choose to turn all
        callouts off in the "Manage Callouts" section.</div>
    <div>3. Stop the beacon: There are several scenarios for which you might set a destination, but not need the audible
        beacon on. For example, you may know exactly how to get to your destination but want to get automatic updates about
        how far away you are from your destination. Or, you may know roughly how to get to your destination, and only need
        the audio beacon as you near your destination. Whatever the case, you can choose when to hear the beacon by toggling
        the "mute beacon"/"unmute beacon" button on the main screen.</div>

    <h2 id="a-26">Do I need to hold the phone in my hand all the time?</h2>
    <div>No! While walking you can put the phone away in a bag or pocket or wherever is convenient. VoiceVista will use
        the direction you are walking to figure out which callouts to announce to your left and to your right. When you
        stop moving, VoiceVista does not know which direction you are facing. If the audible beacon is on, you will
        notice it get quiet until you start moving again. You can pull the phone out to press the location and
        exploration buttons at the bottom of the screen at any time but make sure to hold the phone with the top of the
        phone pointing in the direction you are facing and with the screen to the sky. In this "flat" position,
        VoiceVista will use the phone’s compass to determine which way you are facing and provide accurate spatial
        callouts. If the beacon is on, you will also notice that it returns to full volume.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-26">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-27">In what ways can I personalise my VoiceVista experience?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista allows you to customise some key aspects of the callouts you hear as you are walking:</div>
    <div>1. Voice: You can choose which of the available voices on iOS you would like VoiceVista to use, as well as the speed
        at which callouts are spoken. Select Settings tab, then Voice to adjust the Speaking Rate and Voice settings.
        Additional voices and enhanced voices with a higher quality can be downloaded in the iOS Settings app at
        Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices. </div>
    <div>2. Distance Metric: VoiceVista allows you to hear all distances in either feet or metres. Open system settings app,
        change the option of "Measurement System General" in "General"/ "Language & Region" page. </div>
    <div>3. Markers: You can mark your world with anything you care about. You can mark things that are personal and relevant
        to you like your home, your office and your preferred grocery store. Then VoiceVista will automatically call out
        marked places as you walk by or approach them, or you can also use the Nearby Markers button at the bottom of the
        VoiceVista home screen to hear a spatial callout of marked places around you. These markers will remain personal to
        you and will not be available to anyone else.</div>
    <div>4. Callouts: VoiceVista can tell you about things around you as you approach them by calling out their name from the direction
        they are located in. The app will do this automatically for all sorts of things like businesses, bus stops, and
        even intersections. You can configure what the app automatically calls out in the "Manage Callouts" section of
        the "Settings" screen, and you can turn all callouts off when you want the app to be silent.</div>
    <div>In addition to the above, the following VoiceOver settings can influence how VoiceVista behaves:</div>
    <div>1. VoiceOver Tips: When VoiceOver tips are turned ON, you will hear more information about all the buttons on the
        primary VoiceVista screen. You can turn on VoiceOver tips by navigating to the iOS Settings app and going to
        Accessibility > VoiceOver > Verbosity, and turning the Speak Hints setting on.</div>
    <div>2. Audio Ducking: VoiceVista is designed to work with Audio Ducking turned OFF. When Audio Ducking is on, automatic
        callouts can be difficult to hear if VoiceOver is used simultaneously. We recommend turning Audio Ducking off to
        make it easier to hear all automatic callouts that occur as you are interacting with the phone. Audio ducking can be
        turned off in VoiceOver settings or via the VoiceOver rotor.</div>
    <div>3. Touch ID or Face ID to Unlock: Setting your phone to unlock using Touch ID or Face ID will make unlocking the
        phone fast and easy, and in turn, allow you to access the My Location, Around Me, and Ahead of Me buttons as quickly
        as possible when you are on the go. Set up Touch ID or Face ID unlocking in the iOS Settings app.</div>

    <h2 id="a-28">What is Open Street Map and why do we use it for VoiceVista?</h2>
    <div>VoiceVista draws on geographic map data to provide the information callouts in the app. The primary map source we
        use is Open Street Map (www.openstreetmap.org) which is a rich community generated mapping platform, that
        enables organisations and individuals to improve the quality and granularity of the information provided and the
        accessibility of their spaces using Open Street Map map authoring tools.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-28">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-29">Why is VoiceVista working offline?</h2>
    <div>When there is no internet connection or an outage in the VoiceVista services, VoiceVista transitions into an
        offline mode. Nevertheless, VoiceVista will continue to work, but some functions may be limited.</div>
    <div>Callouts will continue to work if you are in an area that you have walked by before and that has been stored in
        your callout history. Similarly, you can place an audio beacon or create a marker on places that have been
        stored in your callout history.</div>
    <div>VoiceVista will try to resume normal operation when your phone is connected to Wi-Fi or mobile data is enabled
        and you are in an area with good signal. If your phone does have a good internet connection, but VoiceVista does
        not resume normal operation, then there may be an outage in the VoiceVista services.</div>
    <div><a href="faq.html#q-29">TOC</a></div>

    <h2 id="a-30">Do you have more tips?</h2>
    <div>If you put your phone in your pocket and stop moving, the beacon sound will get quieter because VoiceVista can’t
        tell which way you are facing. Solve this by starting to walk again, or pulling your phone out and holding it
        flat.</div>
    <div>You can set a beacon on any address. From the main VoiceVista screen, search for the address. After selecting the
        address in the search results, a "Location Details" screen will be shown and it has an option to "Start Audio
        Beacon" on the address. In this way, you can set a beacon on businesses, places, points of interest, and
        residences that are not in Open Street Maps.</div>
    <div>You can find nearby bus stops by selecting the "Public Transport" filter in the Nearby Places list.</div>
    <div>You can turn on and off the rhythmic sound of the beacon using the mute button on the home screen. If the beacon
        is muted you will still get updates about your distance to your destination every 50 metres or so.</div>
    <div>If you still want to interact with VoiceVista but don’t want to hear automatic callouts you can turn callouts off
        by going to the "Manage Callouts" section of the "Settings" page from the menu. Or, if you aren’t going to
        be using VoiceVista you can put it in either Sleep or Snooze mode using the "Sleep" button on the home screen.
    </div>
    <div>VoiceVista works best when you hold the phone flat with the screen facing the sky and the top of the phone
        pointing away from you.</div>
    <div>If there is a bus route you take regularly, set your pick-up and exit stops as Markers. This way they will be
        saved so you can find them again easily, just go to "Markers" tab and find them in the list. You can set a beacon on
        them and you will get periodic updates on how close you are to your exit stop. Note: you can turn off the rhythmic
        sound and you will still get distance updates along the way.</div>
    <div>Tapping the screen twice with two fingers will silence any active callouts.</div>
