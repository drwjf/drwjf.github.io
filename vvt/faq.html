    <hr>

    <h2>What is VoiceVista and how should I use it?</h2>
    <h3>What is VoiceVista?</h3>
    <p>Microsoft discontinued the project <a href="https://aka.ms/ossblog">Soundscape</a> and made it <a
            href="https://github.com/microsoft/soundscape">open-source</a>. VoiceVista is licensed under <a
            href="https://github.com/microsoft/soundscape/blob/main/LICENSE.txt">the MIT
            License</a> to continue providing the service to blind and vision impaired community.</p>
    <p>VoiceVista helps you stay aware of where you are and where you're going by using unique audio guidance and by
        calling out roads, intersections, and places as you approach them.</p>
    <p>VoiceVista uses 3D sound to let you know what’s around you. For example, if your destination is on your right,
        you will hear sound coming from that direction, or if a coffee shop is on your left, you will hear a callout
        from that direction.</p>
    <p>Place an audio beacon on your destination and VoiceVista will keep you informed of its location and your
        surroundings along the way. Use VoiceVista in conjunction with your wayfinding skills and even your favorite
        navigation app to find your way to your destination.</p>
    <p>Put away the phone and walk. VoiceVista will help you stay aware of where you are by calling out roads,
        intersections, and landmarks as you approach them. Callouts can be adjusted in the settings.</p>
    <p>Hold the phone flat in your hand, and use the buttons to locate roads and upcoming intersections, orient to
        familiar landmarks around you, and explore landmarks ahead of you.</p>

    <h3>When should I use VoiceVista?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista has features and benefits that span a variety of scenarios and time scales. Furthermore, VoiceVista’s
        value to you may evolve over time so how you use it today may differ from how you will use it in three months.
        People often think about apps in terms of "what problem is this app good at solving?" VoiceVista certainly can
        be used on a case by case basis when you have a specific information need – such as keeping track of a
        destination as you make your way there, helping to orient yourself when you emerge from a metro station, getting
        your bearings when exiting a car, or finding the street names for, or distance to, the next intersection.
        However, the philosophy behind VoiceVista is one of "lighting up your world with sound", designed to be used
        anytime you are out and about to provide ambient awareness of your surroundings, such as keeping you aware of
        the names of the streets you are on, the direction you are heading, and the names of businesses you are passing.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I get the best out of VoiceVista?</h2>
    <h3>What are Markers and how do I get the most out of them?</h3>
    <p>Markers are places that you have saved. They could be places that are discoverable within the app, or they could
        be entirely new places you have added yourself. You can save your current location as a marker by selecting the
        "Markers" tab and then tapping top right bar button. You can save other locations as a marker by selecting
        "Nearby Filters" tab, and then searching for the place you would like to save using the search bar, or finding
        somewhere from the nearby places. Once you have found the place you would like, selecting it will take you to
        the "Location Details" page. On this page, tap the top right bar button.</p>

    <h3>What can I set as a beacon?</h3>
    <p>You can set an audio beacon on any business, place, point of interest, address, or intersection. There are a few
        ways you can add a location as a marker. First, view the details for a location by either using the search bar
        to search for a place, or tapping one of the "Places Nearby", "Saved Markers", or "Current Location" buttons and
        selecting a location. From the location details screen you can select the "Start Beacon" button. Tapping this
        will return you to the home screen and turn on an audible beacon coming from the direction of the place you
        selected. The name of the place you have selected along with its distance and physical address, if available,
        will now be displayed on the main app screen.</p>

    <h3>How do I use a beacon like a pro?</h3>
    <p>You can think of the audible beacon as a "lighthouse for the ears", notifying you of where your destination is
        relative to your location, as the crow flies. Like a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may
        need to make many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many strategic
        "tacks" to get closer to the lighthouse. The continuous rhythmic sound of the audible beacon is spatialised
        from the direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of the location of the destination relative to
        you as you walk. When you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone toward the
        destination, a higher pitched "ring" sound will be heard. This feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of
        the destination since the direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud
        environments. When searching for the higher pitched "ring", hold the phone flat and sweep the phone slowly;
        turning your head to point in the same direction of the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio
        experience.</p>
    <p>The lighthouse metaphor for the beacon’s design has several natural implications:</p>
    <p>1. There is no "correct" direction to travel when using the beacon, instead, with VoiceVista you choose how to
        get
        there;</p>
    <p>2. The higher pitched "ring" helps you pinpoint the direction of the destination only – it is not an
        indication of how you should get there;</p>
    <p>3. If you generally know how to get to your destination, you may wish
        to mute the beacon for the majority of your trip and turn it on only as you get closer to your destination.</p>

    <h3>Why does the audible beacon disappear sometimes?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista’s audible beacon is fundamentally a directional cue, telling you where your destination is relative to
        the direction you are facing. When VoiceVista is uncertain about what direction you are facing, it lowers the
        volume of the beacon. Most often this occurs if you have been walking with the phone stored in a pocket or bag,
        and you stop moving, such as to cross a street. The beacon will get louder once you start moving again, or if
        you hold the phone flat and point it in the direction you are facing.</p>

    <h3>Can I set a beacon on an address?</h3>
    <p>Yes you can. Addresses are not listed by default but can be found using the search field. To save this address so
        you don’t need to search for it again, you can add it as a marker from the home screen by selecting the "add to
        markers" button, or using VoiceOver actions on the beacon on the home screen.</p>

    <h3>How do I set a beacon on my home?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista supports setting beacons on addresses. To set a beacon on your home, or any other address, search for
        a location from the main VoiceVista screen. On the "Location Details" screen, tap the "Start Beacon" button.</p>

    <h3>When I set a beacon on a destination, how close will VoiceVista get me to the destination?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista can determine the location of your destination to within several metres, but not less. When VoiceVista
        determines that you are close to your destination, you will hear a final callout that your destination is
        nearby, and the beacon will turn off.</p>

    <h3>Can I turn the beacon back on when I am close to my destination?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can turn the beacon back on once VoiceVista turns it off by selecting the "unmute beacon button";
        however, since Location Services is only accurate to about 10 metres, we cannot guarantee the behaviour of the
        beacon when you are within a few metres of your destination.</p>

    <h3>Why does VoiceVista call out road names twice when I approach an intersection?</h3>
    <p>To accommodate a variety of intersection configurations, VoiceVista describes intersections as segments of
        roadways that depart from a common point. VoiceVista uses spatial audio to indicate the name of the road that
        goes to the left, the name of the road that continues straight ahead, and the name of the road that goes to the
        right, in that order. If the description of the intersection begins with the road you are on rather than one to
        the left, then the intersection is a T with the road you are on continuing ahead and a road intersecting from
        the right. Similarly, if the description only includes a road to the left and to the right, you will know that
        the road you are on ends at a T ahead of you. This method of describing intersections also supports the case
        when a road changes name at an intersection.</p>

    <h3>Why doesn’t VoiceVista announce every business that I pass?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista is designed not to be too chatty. In addition, it uses Open Street Map as its back-end data source.
        Open Street Map (OSM, https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a community-developed and edited map of the world,
        relying on individuals, to enter and curate the data. If a business or point of interest is not announced by
        VoiceVista, the most probable reason is that the business has not been added, or in some cases updated, by a
        member of the OSM community yet.</p>

    <h3>Why do some callouts stop when I'm in a vehicle?</h3>
    <p>In order to stop the number of callouts becoming overwhelming, some categories, such as intersections, are not
        announced automatically when you’re travelling in a vehicle.</p>

    <h3>What if I don't understand a callout or miss it because of ambient noise?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista has a list of your recent callouts so that you can revisit callouts that you might have missed. To
        find this, tap on the search button on the Nearby Filters screen. At the bottom of this page, there is a section
        for "Recent Callouts" where the callout you missed will be listed.</p>

    <h2>How does VoiceVista work?</h2>

    <h3>What phone does VoiceVista run on?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista is currently available for Apple iOS, running on iPhone SE, iPhone 6S and later.</p>

    <h3>What headphones should I use with VoiceVista?</h3>
    <p>Which headphones you use with VoiceVista is a matter of personal preference, and each option comes with benefits
        and trade-offs. The only specific requirement is to use a pair of stereo headphones so that you can take
        advantage of VoiceVista’s 3D spatial audio callouts.</p>

    <h3>How does VoiceVista impact my iPhone’s battery?</h3>
    <p>Battery life varies significantly depending on which iPhone you own and how old it is. The biggest drain on your
        battery is having the screen on, so to maximise the battery life of your phone you should keep the screen locked
        whenever possible. To help minimise the impact on your iPhone battery VoiceVista now has a Sleep Mode and a
        Snooze Mode. To further reduce the amount of battery you use, when you aren’t using VoiceVista, you should force
        close it via your iPhone’s App Switcher. </p>

    <h3>How do I use Sleep Mode to minimise VoiceVista’s impact on my phone battery?</h3>
    <p>To put VoiceVista in to Sleep Mode select the "Sleep" button in the top right hand corner of the screen. When
        you select this VoiceVista will stop using Location Services and mobile data until you choose to wake it up
        again.</p>

    <h3>How do I use Snooze mode to minimise VoiceVista’s impact on my phone battery?</h3>
    <p>To put VoiceVista in to Snooze Mode select the "Sleep" button in the top right hand corner of the screen. Once
        VoiceVista’s in Sleep mode, select the "Wake up when I leave" button and VoiceVista will go in to a low power
        state until you leave your current location.</p>

    <h3>How does my choice of headphones affect the battery life of my phone?</h3>
    <p>In history tests, the battery consumption of Bluetooth headphones is comparable to wired headphones and should
        not be a significant factor to consider when selecting headphones. That said, both earbud and bone-conducting
        headphones have wired and wireless model options.</p>

    <h3>How does running VoiceVista in the background impact battery life of my phone?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista is a location-based app and uses Location Services to determine your location. In our tests,
        VoiceVista does not consume any more battery than the average map application; but if you are concerned about
        battery consumption when using your phone, the following are a few tips which will help lower usage:</p>
    <p>1. Turn the screen display off as much as possible when you are not interacting with the app.</p>
    <p>2. When not using the app, close it down. VoiceVista uses location services continually when it is running so
        that it always knows
        your location, even when you are not moving. Don’t forget to restart the app when you resume your journey.</p>
    <p>3. In cold weather, keep your phone warm as batteries perform more poorly in colder temperatures.</p>

    <h3>How much mobile data does VoiceVista use?</h3>
    <p>The amount of mobile data used depends on how you use VoiceVista. We have designed VoiceVista to use only a small
        amount of data when you’re out and about by doing things like saving points as you walk around so you don’t need
        to download them again every time you go back to somewhere you’ve already been. To reduce the amount of mobile
        data you use, make sure you are connected to Wi-Fi whenever possible, particularly to download the app. When you
        are not using VoiceVista, you should use the "Sleep" button to put VoiceVista to sleep or force close the app.
    </p>

    <h3>How is VoiceVista different from other map apps?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista provides an ambient description of your surroundings in aid of exploration and way-finding. Using
        spatial audio, VoiceVista will call out points of interest, parks, roads, and intersections from the direction
        they physically are in your immediate environment as you walk. For example, if you pass a shop on your right,
        you will hear the name of the shop sounding from your right. As you approach an intersection, you will hear each
        road name sounding from the direction it goes in, beginning to your left, ahead and to the right.</p>
    <p>Instead of turn by turn directions as often provided by other map applications, VoiceVista will play an audible
        beacon in the direction of your destination, empowering you to make your way there on your terms using your
        increased awareness of your surroundings and the location of your destination. VoiceVista is designed to run in
        the background, enabling you to use a turn by turn directions app, all the while continuing to provide
        environmental awareness as you make your way to your destination.</p>

    <h3>How do I use VoiceVista with a wayfinding app?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista is designed as an awareness app to help fill in details about your environment that you may not be
        aware of otherwise. While it is not designed as a turn-by-turn navigation app, it can be used alongside such
        apps to provide complementary information. To use VoiceVista with these apps, start your navigation app first.
        Then, move over to VoiceVista and set a beacon on the same destination as in the navigation app. At this point,
        both apps will be running and you will hear walking directions from your navigation app, while getting updates
        on points of interest, intersections, and your distance to your destination from VoiceVista.</p>

    <h3>How do I control what I hear and when I hear it in VoiceVista?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista provides several ways to control what you hear and when:</p>
    <p>1. Immediately stop all audio: Double tap the screen with two fingers to immediately turn off all audio,
        including any callout that is currently playing
        and the beacon if it is on. Callouts will resume automatically when you approach the next intersection or point
        of interest, but the audible beacon will not. Select the "unmute beacon button" on the main screen to resume
        hearing the beacon.</p>
    <p>2. Stop automatic callouts: When you are not travelling or have reached a destination, you probably will not need
        VoiceVista to continue to notify you of things around you. Instead of exiting the app,
        you can put VoiceVista in to Snooze mode and it will wake up again when you leave, or you can put VoiceVista
        into Sleep mode and it will stay off until you choose to turn it back on. Alternatively, you can select
        "Settings" from the menu and choose to turn all callouts off in the "Manage Callouts" section.</p>
    <p>3. Stop the beacon: There are several scenarios for which you might set a destination, but not need the audible
        beacon on. For example, you may know exactly how to get to your destination but want to get automatic updates
        about
        how far away you are from your destination. Or, you may know roughly how to get to your destination, and only
        need
        the audio beacon as you near your destination. Whatever the case, you can choose when to hear the beacon by
        toggling
        the "mute beacon"/"unmute beacon" button on the main screen.</p>

    <h3>Do I need to hold the phone in my hand all the time?</h3>
    <p>No! While walking you can put the phone away in a bag or pocket or wherever is convenient. VoiceVista will use
        the direction you are walking to figure out which callouts to announce to your left and to your right. When you
        stop moving, VoiceVista does not know which direction you are facing. If the audible beacon is on, you will
        notice it get quiet until you start moving again. You can pull the phone out to press the location and
        exploration buttons at the bottom of the screen at any time but make sure to hold the phone with the top of the
        phone pointing in the direction you are facing and with the screen to the sky. In this "flat" position,
        VoiceVista will use the phone’s compass to determine which way you are facing and provide accurate spatial
        callouts. If the beacon is on, you will also notice that it returns to full volume.</p>

    <h3>In what ways can I personalise my VoiceVista experience?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista allows you to customise three key aspects of the callouts you hear as you are walking:</p>
    <p>1. Voice: You can choose which of the available voices on iOS you would like VoiceVista to use, as well as the
        speed
        at which callouts are spoken. From the Menu, select Settings, then Voice to adjust the Speaking Rate and Voice
        settings. Additional voices and enhanced voices with a higher quality can be downloaded in the iOS Settings app
        at Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices. </p>
    <p>2. Distance Metric: VoiceVista allows you to hear all distances in either feet or metres. From the Menu, select
        Settings. The Units of Measure section allows you to toggle between two options: Imperial (feet) and Metric
        (metres).</p>
    <p>3. Markers: You can mark your world with anything you care about. You can mark things that are personal and
        relevant
        to you like your home, your office and your preferred grocery store. Then VoiceVista will automatically call out
        marked places as you walk by or approach them, or you can also use the Nearby Markers button at the bottom of
        the
        VoiceVista home screen to hear a spatial callout of marked places around you. These markers will remain personal
        to
        you and will not be available to anyone else.</p>
    <p>In addition to the above, the following VoiceOver settings can influence how VoiceVista behaves:</p>
    <p>1. VoiceOver Tips: When VoiceOver tips are turned ON, you will hear more information
        about all the buttons on the primary VoiceVista screen. You can turn on VoiceOver tips by navigating to the iOS
        Settings app and going to Accessibility > VoiceOver > Verbosity, and turning the Speak Hints setting on.</p>
    <p>2. Audio Ducking: VoiceVista is designed to work with Audio Ducking turned OFF. When Audio Ducking is on,
        automatic
        callouts can be difficult to hear if VoiceOver is used simultaneously. We recommend turning Audio Ducking off to
        make it easier to hear all automatic callouts that occur as you are interacting with the phone. Audio ducking
        can be turned off in VoiceOver settings or via the VoiceOver rotor.</p>
    <p>3. Touch ID or Face ID to Unlock: Setting your phone to unlock using Touch ID or Face ID will make unlocking the
        phone fast and easy, and in turn, allow you to access the My Location, Around Me, and Ahead of Me buttons as
        quickly
        as possible when you are on the go. Set up Touch ID or Face ID unlocking in the iOS Settings app.</p>

    <h3>What is Open Street Map and why do we use it for VoiceVista?</h3>
    <p>VoiceVista draws on geographic map data to provide the information callouts in the app. The primary map source we
        use is Open Street Map (www.openstreetmap.org) which is a rich community generated mapping platform, that
        enables organisations and individuals to improve the quality and granularity of the information provided and the
        accessibility of their spaces using Open Street Map map authoring tools.</p>

    <h2>Why is VoiceVista working offline?</h2>
    <p>When there is no internet connection or an outage in the VoiceVista services, VoiceVista transitions into an
        offline mode. Nevertheless, VoiceVista will continue to work, but some functions may be limited.</p>
    <p>Callouts will continue to work if you are in an area that you have walked by before and that has been stored in
        your callout history. Similarly, you can place an audio beacon or create a marker on places that have been
        stored in your callout history.</p>
    <p>VoiceVista will try to resume normal operation when your phone is connected to Wi-Fi or mobile data is enabled
        and you are in an area with good signal. If your phone does have a good internet connection, but VoiceVista does
        not resume normal operation, then there may be an outage in the VoiceVista services.</p>

    <h2>Do you have more tips?</h2>
    <p>If you put your phone in your pocket and stop moving, the beacon sound will get quieter because VoiceVista can’t
        tell which way you are facing. Solve this by starting to walk again, or pulling your phone out and holding it
        flat.</p>
    <p>You can set a beacon on any address. From the main VoiceVista screen, search for the address. After selecting the
        address in the search results, a "Location Details" screen will be shown and it has an option to "Start Audio
        Beacon" on the address. In this way, you can set a beacon on businesses, places, points of interest, and
        residences that are not in Open Street Maps.</p>
    <p>You can find nearby bus stops by selecting the "Public Transport" filter in the Nearby Places list.</p>
    <p>You can turn on and off the rhythmic sound of the beacon using the mute button on the home screen. If the beacon
        is muted you will still get updates about your distance to your destination every 50 metres or so.</p>
    <p>If you still want to interact with VoiceVista but don’t want to hear automatic callouts you can turn callouts off
        by going to the "Manage Callouts" section of the "Settings" page from the menu. Or, if you aren’t going to
        be using VoiceVista you can put it in either Sleep or Snooze mode using the "Sleep" button on the home screen.
    </p>
    <p>VoiceVista works best when you hold the phone flat with the screen facing the sky and the top of the phone
        pointing away from you.</p>
    <p>If there is a bus route you take regularly, set your pick-up and exit stops as Markers. This way they will be
        saved so you can find them again easily, just go to "Manage Markers" from the menu and find them in the list.
        You can set a beacon on them and you will get periodic updates on how close you are to your exit stop. Note: you
        can turn off the rhythmic sound and you will still get distance updates along the way.</p>
    <p>Tapping the screen twice with two fingers will silence any active callouts.</p>
