                “But I moved to VoiceVista, which is still Soundscape at its core, but has had a lot of updates and an updated
                interface, and I actually really like VoiceVista. Still, based on the Soundscape technology, it has more
                updates. There's changes happening all the time.”

                “And VoiceVista, by the way, yes, Breaking News is starting.
                Oh, hang on, hang on.
                Breaking News.
                It has now started working for me again. Hang on, what? That's not news.
                No, no, wait, wait, wait. For the longest time, I was saying, look, it reads out all the markers, so the GPS
                must be working. That's all fine.
                It tells me what, you know, the number of the house I'm in front of when I'm walking down the street. It just
                won't read out the intersections, even though they're all turned on. It won't do it.
                Well, now it started working again, and there has been an update in the last couple of days which adds all these
                funky new sounds to everything. So now when I took the dog out this morning, I was beeping and bopping all over
                the place every time I walked past something.
                Yeah, but what about the app?
                It's working perfectly. Go to sleep. It's working perfectly right now.
                And I've got to say, I still think VoiceVista is absolutely amazing. I can't give enough praise to the developer
                for the work he's done on that. And I believe it's even made it[…]”

                “Camille has been in touch on the subject of VoiceVista.
                Now that the temperature is well warm enough to allow me to handle my iPhone without freezing my fingers, I gave
                VoiceVista a trial run. Zero degrees and feels like minus six. First, I did not think the app would work without
                a data plan, but it does.
                It mentioned all the intersections, streets, schools and businesses I walked by. It also mentioned the bus
                stops, but consistently telling me that they were 15 metres behind while I was standing at the bus stop. For some reasons,
                it also mentioned the previous and current name of the grocery store.
                It omitted to mention the pharmacy or drugstore, not sure what you call those in the UK. It told me I reached a
                max of six kilometres per hour, which I do not think is quite accurate, as I walk every day and usually walk five
                kilometres per hour according to my Fitbit watch and app. Today was a good day as I managed to walk 25,000 steps.
                So, thanks for the recommendation, Shaun. Steven, if he is interested, could use VoiceVista to find nearest KFC.
                Hello.
                Happy tapping, Camille.

                in your community knows Portuguese speakers in the UK or Canada who might have feedback or suggestions for improving the

                “You mentioned that your VoiceVista is reading out your speed every now and again. Yeah, mine's doing this as
                well.
                I believe, I think I saw in the settings somewhere that it's every 100 meters by default.
        
                It will give you your current, well, mine at least, gives me my GPS accuracy, the direction that I'm traveling
                in, and current speed. But mine reads out in kilometers per hour. But you gave your speed in miles per hour.
        
                Is yours reading out in miles per hour? In which case, do you know how you got it to do that? Because I would
                prefer that.
        
                Mine's reading out in, so my top speed, if we're getting into this, has been so far as four kilometers per hour,
                which according to Lady A is about two and a half miles per hour. But I'm the same as you. I heard VoiceVista
                doing this.
        
                And then my instant thought was when I heard my speed, I instantly started speeding up. I was like, I bet I can
                top that. Me too.
        
                It's become a little bit of fun now when I'm on my way to and from work, trying to beat my speed[…]”

                “There is a feature in VoiceVista. If you go to the settings and go to call-outs and turn absolutely everything
                on, because I can't remember the individual option name.
        
                Just turn everything on.
        
                Everything on. When you're walking, it will say at some point, it will say the house number of the street you're
                on.
                And it will also say current speed.
        
                And it's usually one mile per hour for me. But today, I hit maximum speed of three miles. Honestly.
        
                Yay!
        
                Now I'm getting it. Okay, right.
        
                Honestly, I've never felt so alive. I've never felt so free. I'm just saying, I think this should be a segment.
        
                I want everyone to test their speed, right? You know, there was a show over here called Top Gear. And they used
                to have Star in a reasonably priced car.
        
                And they used to go around the track and whoever was fastest. And they had a leaderboard. I think this is our
                segment.
        
                We should do this. Who's fastest on VoiceVista? Obviously we need to work on the name, but I think this could be
                amazing.
        
                Blind person going to the store the fastest.

                “I am a keen beta tester using VoiceVista and instrumented the introduction of route creation with breadcrumb
                mode,
                for example, which I don't think you've covered, but an absolute game changer for blind people.
        
                It would allow, for example, to allow you to go out with a sighted person, creating a route with breadcrumbs,
                and then independently allow you to follow the same route later on your own. I use this when I am out on my tandem
                bike cycling with a cycling club and then go with a pilot on my own and can separately navigate the bike or on a
                walking route as part of a group and then later want to repeat the route on your own. Anyway, keep well, keep up the
                energy, and enjoy the break during the month of May.
        
                Brian.

                Yes, thank you very much. And great work on your work on VoiceVista, by the way. I am still having issues.

                “Now for VoiceVista.
        
                I've just had a little play with that again, and I have something called crosswalks. I don't have intersections
                either. And I think the crosswalks, my wife says, are the places where you cross traffic lights.
        
                When you get the green man in the UK, other countries may have something different. So that's the kind of thing
                that we get, crosswalks. I don't get intersections.
        
                I don't get unnamed streets, possibly because the street hasn't got a name. So that's how VoiceVista is working
                for me at the moment. And it's regularly updated.
        
                And I think it's now worth giving serious consideration to having it paid for. So I shall do so. Just a couple
                of other things.”

                “Shaun was complaining yesterday about VoiceVista not mentioning intersections, yet everything else seems to be
                fine. I would suggest he goes to Settings, then Callouts, then go down to Intersections and Junctions and make
                sure it is turned on. I suspect this somehow has been turned off.
        
                There are other selections which you should turn on, as desired, in the list under Callouts, including, at the
                top of the list, a master switch to turn on all choices. Regards, Graham Langford in Toronto.
        
                God bless you, Graham. Yes, now I have checked all that, and this is so strange. Doesn't work in the morning,
                works absolutely fine in the afternoon.
        
                I have no idea why, and it's the same across every Soundscape and VoiceVista. It must be the GPS, it must be

                It's not mandatory. That is a voluntary subscription. You don't have to subscribe to use it.
        
                It's just if you want to help support development and its ongoing use, then you have the ability to subscribe.

                I just think it's really well done. I like the interface of it. I always thought the SignScape interface wasn't
                that great.
        
                It was a little bit cluttered. I really like what he's done with the interface. You know, buttons with actions.
        
                You can swipe up to just select your roots and everything like that. And I just think the features are really
                nice. I like the marker is behind you or just in front of you call out as well.
        
                I just think it's really well done, to be honest.
        
                And am I right in saying that there's a subscription model coming to that?
        
                There is, yes. In the latest update I noticed, there is a voluntary subscription model to help with
                sustainability and development. So there's no limitation if you choose not to subscribe.
        
                You still get the full features of it. But you can choose to subscribe in the case here in the UK. I think it
                was 99p a month or for an annual fee of 8.99.

                well to get everyone on board.
        
                But I find Voice of Vista really interesting because it gives me the actual address of where I'm near as well,
                which I really like. And it also gives me, such as the bench is just behind you, I noticed this morning, which
                is really cool. But I've also noticed that it doesn't always, it seems a little bit inconsistent in telling me
                I'm coming up to an intersection.
        
                So I tend to have Soundscape, whichever version, and the Voice Vista running at the same time, and I get every
                bit of information I could possibly want. So I do see where you're coming from, but I do kind of worry. The
                Soundscape community and the Scottish Tech Army Soundscape, they do seem incredibly similar at the moment.
        
                Now, we don't know what future development and add-on features are going to come, but I can't find a difference
                between them. And at the moment, when I ask Lady S to open Soundscape, it says, which one? Soundscape,
                Soundscape or[…]”

                “Voice Vista has sort of saved my life recently, you know, because I've been using that every day since you've
                been unable to download SoundScape from the App Store, Microsoft SoundScape. And, you know, Open-scape, they were the
                ones that first kicked all this off, but as far as I know, they're still in beta at the moment.
        
                And I think it's the original team, as Kirsty was saying, I think the original team behind SoundScape are
                actually involved in that project.
        
                It sounds great, right? It's like I don't want to put them down whatsoever. The developer of Voice Vista has
                been pumping out updates all the time, he's added AirPod head tracking support and all that sort of good stuff.”

                “So what I might suggest you do as an alternative, Debbie, is search for VoiceVista.
        
                Because it is another application which is using the Soundscape, I guess, elements of the Soundscape application
                in there. So you could use that as an option. There's also Good Maps Outdoors.
        
                I haven't tried it. It's not great in the UK, so it's not something we can really try out properly. And give it
                a fair review.
        
                But others have said it is very good, and it also does contain elements of it. But I think VoiceVista is the
                closest that is available that you could go and download today.
        
                It's excellent, VoiceVista. I must admit I'm using that all the time. They've just released an update which
                includes AirPod head tracking support.
        
                Well, that's good. Yeah, so now it's getting closer and closer to the original Soundscape. And as you said
                there, it's available now officially in the App Store and none of this beta.
        
                But I just Googled OpenScape beta and I found it through Google to sign up to the beta program. But honestly, I
                don't know if they're still accepting at the moment.
        
                Yeah, that could be the problem. But[…]”

                “It's funny how tired... and it seems ridiculous to say, but I've noticed, because I've been using VoiceVista a
                lot when I've started taking the dog out in the morning again, getting my physio up and running, sort of stumbling,
                hobbling.
        
                So I've been using VoiceVista and when I don't use it, there's odd times I forget because I'm too tired. I'm
                just stumbling out the door. You've got to concentrate so much more.
        
                What something like VoiceVista Soundscape OpenScape gives you is the ability to, you know what, turn off your
                brain for a second because I'm not constantly looking out for the signs or the tactile landmarks, if you will, that
                I'm coming to the turning in the road or whatever. I can just wait until I'm actually told. It's nice to be able not
                to concentrate 100% of the time.
        
                I think that's where you get tired because you do. You're constantly thinking what's coming up next, where am I
                now? It's exhausting.”

                “Oh yeah, there was a new update released recently yesterday, day before for VoiceVista, which does support the
                import and export of markers. Because someone did mention this before and I couldn't find it anywhere. I went
                into Soundscape thinking, I must be able to export the set audio markers.
        
                Could I find it? I have no idea. I went through settings, I went through the markers area.
        
                Couldn't find how to export at all.
        
                You should have taken your time and figured it out.
        
                What I'm saying though, Steven, is I do not believe it was there. I will check it out though. All right, I'm
                just saying.
        
                I did notice in the update notes for VoiceVista, all right, stop. It did mention the support for importing and
                exporting the markers. So I'm going to look in how to actually do that.”

                “A few seconds after sending my email, I came across an app called VoiceVista. This is available for free on the
                iOS
                App Store and is another soundscape fork.
        
                I've only had a very quick play with it. The main difference is that the menu in the top left is gone, and there
                is
                a settings tab instead. But other than language, there's not much in there.
        
                No head tracking support, for example. But it's available for everyone now, and it's free. The developer looks
                like
                he makes a lot of games that are very popular on Apple Viz, so that's a good sign.”

                And this is for you, Michael, in Schornberg. It now has the ability to virtually place you somewhere. Michael
                was
                looking for that feature as well.
        
                So you can say, I'm at this hotel, but you're not really. You can place your location there and have a look
                around,
                which is cool.

                “Also, I want to mention Voice Vista, because Voice Vista is a new app, which a lot of you have been telling me
                about over the weekend on the emails. And this is kind of another version or another fork, as they call it, of
                SoundScape, Microsoft SoundScape as it was. Voice Vista seems to be using elements from the SoundScape code in
                this new app, which is available.
        
                You can go download it now. It's free to download.
        
                This is the first one. It's actually in the app store, as far as I'm aware. OpenScape, obviously, we've talked
                about before, but still in beta.
        
                But this one you can get right now. And I have been using it.”
        
                “There are things that aren't in there, like the 3D head tracking, stuff like that isn't in Voice Vista yet,
                that may come in time. But those, I've seen a lot of people who are beta testing Openscape, who are saying Openscape
                still wins it, so far. So, you know-
        
                That's interesting.
        
                Well, it's considering it's the same code. It's the same code.
        
                I will say, Voice Vista do it slightly different. At this current time, Openscape is a one-to-one copy, almost
                interface-wise, at least. It is using Apple Maps for its data, whereas the others aren't, I don't think.
        
                But Voice Vista, when I tried that, they've put their own UI on it, so everything's split into tabs. Look around
                is a separate tab to what's nearby or whatever it may be, roots and markers. They're all tabs in Voice Vista.
        
                But I just used it for, okay, what intersection is coming up, which it's so useful for? And I gotta say, I had
                all three running at once. Voice Vista gave me extra information.
        
                Like what? Such as the name of the pub I was walking past. None of the others did that.
