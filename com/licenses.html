          is a free, portable, general-purpose computer algebra system (CAS) that can symbolically
          solve, simplify, combine, and compare algebraic equations, and can perform complex number, modular, and
          polynomial arithmetic, along with standard arithmetic. Development of Mathomatic was started in the year 1986
          by George Gesslein II.

          The Canterbury Puzzles And Other Curious Problems, by Henry Ernest Dudeney, originally published in 1907. "It
          is a book of remarkable ingenuity and interest." —- Educational Times. "The most ingenious brain in England
          ... a fascinating new book." —- Evening News. "A capital book of posers." —- Daily News. "The Puzzles ...
          reach the limit of ingenuity and intricacy; and it is well for the sanity of his readers that the author gives
          a list of solutions at the end of the book." —- Observer. </li>
        <li>Amusements in Mathematics, by Henry Ernest Dudeney, originally published in 1917. "In Mathematicks he was
          greater than Tycho Brahe or Erra Pater: For he, by geometrick scale, Could take the size of pots of ale;
          Resolve, by sines and tangents, straight, If bread or butter wanted weight; And wisely tell what hour o' th'
          day The clock does strike by algebra. -- BUTLER'S Hudibras."</li>
