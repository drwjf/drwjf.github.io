    <ul>
        <li>
            Mode inspired by <b>Strategic Simulations Inc's</b> Panzer General and based on <b>lGeneral</b>.
            <p>
                The game requires the player to use combined-arms tactics, where each unit is strong against some unit types but
                very vulnerable to others. Dug-in enemy positions must be softened by artillery, which is vulnerable and needs
                protection. Before attacking the infantry and anti-tank, one needs first to destroy the enemy
                artillery that protects them from behind. If no tanks can get within range, one does this mostly by bombers,
                but then it is advantageous to destroy the air defense units first. The fighter planes must negotiate dual roles:
                destroying the enemy air force and protecting their own bombers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The player must carefully observe the road system to speed the advance, or may use Bridge engineers to cross the
                rivers. The game rewards a Blitzkrieg strategy - penetrating deep into the enemy positions while postponing the
                destruction of some of the encountered enemy units for later.
            </p>
            <p>
                The performance of units is increased by their experience points, which are acquired through combat. In Campaign
                mode particularly, one then has to protect the experienced units as the most valuable assets.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Mode revived from <b>Spiffcode's</b> Warfare Incorporated
            <p>
                The mode is set in a future ruled by super corporations engaged in no-holds-barred competition for the
                resources of the galaxy. The action centers around the newly discovered planet Icarus with its astounding mineral
                wealth and mysterious alien relics. Players take the role of a junior executive at the underdog ACME Exploration
                Corporation, discoverer of Icarus, and work their way up the corporate ladder by demonstrating their strategic and
                tactical skills in a campaign of increasingly challenging missions. Early missions concentrate on resource gathering and
                combat with ACME's chief rival OMNI Industries and as the game develops other factions and the power of the alien
                technologies come into play.
