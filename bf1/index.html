    <h2>Updates at 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Mode inspired by <b>Strategic Simulations Inc's</b> Panzer General and <b>lGeneral</b>.
            <p>
                The game requires the player to use combined-arms tactics, where each unit is strong against some unit
                types but very vulnerable to others. Dug-in enemy positions must be softened by artillery, which is
                vulnerable and needs protection. Before attacking the infantry and anti-tank, one needs first to destroy
                the enemy artillery that protects them from behind. If no tanks can get within range, one does this
                mostly by bombers, but then it is advantageous to destroy the air defense units first. The fighter
                planes must negotiate dual roles: destroying the enemy air force and protecting their own bombers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The player must carefully observe the road system to speed the advance, or may use Bridge engineers to
                cross the rivers. The game rewards a Blitzkrieg strategy - penetrating deep into the enemy positions
                while postponing the destruction of some of the encountered enemy units for later.
            </p>
            <p>
                The performance of units is increased by their experience points, which are acquired through combat. In
                Campaign mode particularly, one then has to protect the experienced units as the most valuable assets.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Mode revived from <b>Spiffcode's</b> Warfare Incorporated
            <p>
                The mode is set in a future ruled by super corporations engaged in no-holds-barred competition for the
                resources of the galaxy. The action centers around the newly discovered planet Icarus with its
                astounding mineral wealth and mysterious alien relics. Players take the role of a junior executive at
                the underdog ACME Exploration Corporation, discoverer of Icarus, and work their way up the corporate
                ladder by demonstrating their strategic and tactical skills in a campaign of increasingly challenging
                missions. Early missions concentrate on resource gathering and combat with ACME's chief rival OMNI
                Industries and as the game develops other factions and the power of the alien technologies come into
                play.

    <ul>
        <li>
            An iOS game inspired by <b>Blue Byte's</b> Battle Isle and <b>Crimson Fields</b>.
            <p>
                A tactical turn-based war game of two opposing sides (Empire of Kand and Free Nexus Army). Facing either
                the computer, turns are taken to move various military units and attack the opposition.
